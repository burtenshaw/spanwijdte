It's a joy to see new green shoots of cultural tendencies emerging from barren soil.' - Douglas Coupland, Artist and Author, Generation XYou Are Here: Art After the Internet is the first major publication to critically explore both the effects and affects that the Internet has had on contemporary artistic practices.Responding to an era that has increasingly chosen to dub itself as 'post-internet', this collective text traces a potted narrative exploring the relationship of the Internet to art practices from the early millennium to the present day.The book positions itself as a provocation on the current state of cultural production, relying on first-person accounts from artists, writers and curators as the primary source material.The book raises urgent questions about how we negotiate the formal, aesthetic and conceptual relationship of art and its effects after the ubiquitous rise of the Internet.Published by Cornerhouse and SPACE.'Curator and editor Omar Kholief's recent book of essays and projects from artists has perfectly captured how artists have engaged with the context of the internet.

First, they target only one particular social media platform (SMP). Second, they address just one topic of cyberbullying. Third, they rely on carefully handcrafted features of the data. We show that deep learning based models can overcome all three bottlenecks. Knowledge learned by these models on one dataset can be transferred to other datasets. We performed extensive experiments using three real-world datasets: Formspring (12k posts), Twitter (16k posts), and Wikipedia(100k posts). Our experiments provide several useful insights about cyberbullying detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically analyzes cyberbullying detection on various topics across multiple SMPs using deep learning based models and transfer learning.},

  abstract = {Prior to the innovation of information communication technologies (ICT), social interactions evolved within small cultural boundaries such as geo spatial locations. The recent developments of communication technologies have considerably transcended the temporal and spatial limitations of traditional communications. These social technologies have created a revolution in user-generated information, online human networks, and rich human behavior-related data. However, the misuse of social technologies such as social media (SM) platforms, has introduced a new form of aggression and violence that occurs exclusively online. A new means of demonstrating aggressive behavior in SM websites are highlighted in this paper. The motivations for the construction of prediction models to fight aggressive behavior in SM are also outlined. We comprehensively review cyberbullying prediction models and identify the main issues related to the construction of cyberbullying prediction models in SM. This paper provides insights on the overall process for cyberbullying detection and most importantly overviews the methodology. Though data collection and feature engineering process has been elaborated, yet most of the emphasis is on feature selection algorithms and then using various machine learning algorithms for prediction of cyberbullying behaviors. Finally, the issues and challenges have been highlighted as well, which present new research directions for researchers to explore.},

  year = {2003},
  abstract = {While not always distorting the truth about a given cultural phenom- enon, to control and master it all too often deadens its impact, arresting its creative effects. Ironically, however, in controlling and mastering Roland Barthes's dauntingly variegated oeuvre, in bringing coherence to its wilful contradictions, the author of this volume liberates that work, making it available as one of the best examples of free critical thinking that the twentieth century had to offer.' Robert Harvey, State University of New York at Stony Brook Roland Barthes is a central figure in the study of language, literature, culture and the media, both as innovator and guide. This book prepares readers for their first encounter with his crucial writings on some of the most important theoretical debates of the twentieth century, including: \textbullet{} Existentialism and Marxism \textbullet{} semiology, or the `language of signs' \textbullet{} structuralism and narrative analysis \textbullet{} post-structuralism, deconstruction and `the death of the author' \textbullet{} theories of the text and intertextuality. In exploring Barthes's most influential ideas and their impact, Graham Allen traces his engagement with other key thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Ferdinand de Saussure, Jacques Derrida and Julia Kristeva. He concludes with a guide to easily available translations of key texts by Barthes and offers invaluable advice on further reading. The in-depth understanding of Barthes offered by this guide is essen- tial to anyone reading contemporary critical theory.},

Best known for his collaborative work with Gilles Deleuze, Guattari's own writings are still a relatively unmined resource in continental philosophy. Many of his books have not yet been translated into English. Yet his influence has been considerable and far-reaching. This book explores the full spectrum of Guattari's work, reassessing its contemporary significance and giving due weight to his highly innovative contributions to a variety of fields, including linguistics, economics, pragmatics, ecology, aesthetics and media theory. Readers grappling with the ideas of contemporary continental philosophers such as Badiou, \v{Z}i\v{z}ek and Ranci\`ere will at last be able to see Guattari as the `extraordinary philosopher' Deleuze claimed him to be, with his distinctive radical ideas about the epoch of global `deterritorialization' we live in today, forged within the practical contexts of revolutionary politics and the materialist critique of psychoanalysis.},

  abstract = {A report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in BA 1 [N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea] having a (low) molecular mass M = 111.104. Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA 1, at a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality (1.7 percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and, in one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia. Under otherwise unchanged conditions the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of 47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a lethality of 18 percent. (Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the recovery rate.) However this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different (complementary) mechanisms of action. Leucocyte counts made after application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1 and with ifosfamide, the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics. In combination with the cited plaque test for BA 1, blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status. Since IF can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the DS carcinosarcoma in rats -- these findings are of special importance. Finally, the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumour-free rats after i.v. application of BA 1. The thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising.},

The authors ask why this work has proved so important, examining its contexts, implications and impact. With its accessible style, clear explanations of key terms, end-of- chapter summaries and fully annotated guide to further reading, this revised and fully updated edition of a book first published in 1999 is the ideal companion for readers new to Said.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

We demonstrated the effectiveness of our model by applying the architecture in different tasks: three corpora and three language tasks. Experimental results on all tasks and languages show that our method with attention mechanism outperforms the baseline model with a higher correlation with human annotation.},

This book guides the reader through Baudrillard's work, from his first publication to his later postmodern statements. Richard J. Lane offers an impressively clear introduction to key aspects of Baudrillard's thought, from his reworking of Marxism through to his theories on technology, primitivism, simulation and the hyperreal,America and the postmodern.Throughout the volume, ideas are considered in relation to the social and intellectual contexts in which Baudrillard worked, and special attention is paid to the ongoing narratives of French and postmodern thought. An extensively anno- tated bibliography of primary and secondary texts prepares the student reader for further encounters with Baudrillard's work. Tracing a sure path through often complex writings, Jean Baudrillard is the perfect companion for those newly approaching this key contem- porary thinker.},

  abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent ``High Throughput'' methods achieve surprising success\textemdash they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much.

The type and extent of this engagement can be manipulated by providing the characters with distinct personalities. For this reason computational storytelling systems can benefit from explicitly representing personality. We present the results of an empirical study that evaluates whether the perceived personality of fictional characters created by our simulation-based narrative generator correlates with those computationally modeled. Motivated by the mimetic narrative theory of fictional minds the system models characters' action selection using an agent architecture grounded in a cognitive understanding of personality and affect. Results from our study support the claim that our system is capable of depicting narrative personality, that cognitive models are a viable approach to representing characters, and that a search-space of plot can be explored using character-personality as parameter. This can be taken to also provide functional evidence in support of the employed analytical narrative theory.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a model of simple question-answer punning, implemented in a program, JAPE, which generates riddles from humour-independent lexical entries. The model uses two main types of structure: schemata, which determine the relationships between key words in a joke, and templates, which produce the surface form of the joke. JAPE succeeds in generating pieces of text that are recognizably jokes, but some of them are not very good jokes. We mention some potential improvements and extensions, including post-production heuristics for ordering the jokes according to quality.},

  abstract = {Training large-scale question answering systems is complicated because training sources usually cover a small portion of the range of possible questions. This paper studies the impact of multitask and transfer learning for simple question answering; a setting for which the reasoning required to answer is quite easy, as long as one can retrieve the correct evidence given a question, which can be difficult in large-scale conditions. To this end, we introduce a new dataset of 100k questions that we use in conjunction with existing benchmarks. We conduct our study within the framework of Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015) because this perspective allows us to eventually scale up to more complex reasoning, and show that Memory Networks can be successfully trained to achieve excellent performance.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash 156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {The Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus (TSCC) is a collection of written conversations captured during one-to-one lessons between teachers and learners of English. The lessons took place in an online chatroom and therefore involve more interactive, immediate and informal language than might be found in asynchronous exchanges such as email correspondence. The fact that the lessons were one-to-one means that the teacher was able to focus exclusively on the linguistic abilities and errors of the student, and to offer personalised exercises, scaffolding and correction. The TSCC contains more than one hundred lessons between two teachers and eight students, amounting to 13.5K conversational turns and 133K words: it is freely available for research use. We describe the corpus design, data collection procedure and annotations added to the text. We perform some preliminary descriptive analyses of the data and consider possible uses of the TSCC.},

We perform an extensive evaluation in standard benchmarks from text categorization and sentiment analysis. Our results show that a simple tokenization of the input text is often enough, but also highlight the importance of being consistent in the preprocessing of the evaluation set and the corpus used for training word embeddings.},

  abstract = {There is intense public interest in questions surrounding how children learn to read and how they can best be taught. Research in psychological science has provided answers to many of these questions but, somewhat surprisingly, this research has been slow to make inroads into educational policy and practice. Instead, the field has been plagued by decades of ``reading wars.'' Even now, there remains a wide gap between the state of research knowledge about learning to read and the state of public understanding. The aim of this article is to fill this gap. We present a comprehensive tutorial review of the science of learning to read, spanning from children's earliest alphabetic skills through to the fluent word recognition and skilled text comprehension characteristic of expert readers. We explain why phonics instruction is so central to learning in a writing system such as English. But we also move beyond phonics, reviewing research on what else children need to learn to become expert readers and considering how this might be translated into effective classroom practice. We call for an end to the reading wars and recommend an agenda for instruction and research in reading acquisition that is balanced, developmentally informed, and based on a deep understanding of how language and writing systems work.},

Method       A descriptive approach is used to review research concerning the cognitive basis of          reading comprehension. Educational implications for instruction and assessment are          considered. The role of the speech-language pathologist (SLP) in intervention related          to reading comprehension is also addressed.              Conclusion       Although the narrow view of reading seems restrictive, it actually leads to a broad          view of comprehension. The latter view, which is consistent with current research,          proposes that comprehension is an active process in which readers use background knowledge          and a range of cognitive processes to construct a coherent representation of text.          This view challenges some current approaches to assessment and instruction of reading          comprehension. It does not, however, diminish the role that SLPs can play in intervention          related to reading comprehension.},

Although state-of-the-art deep learning models for video game tasks generally rely on more complex methods such as deep-Q learning, we show that a supervised model which requires substantially fewer resources and training time can already perform well at human reaction speeds on the N64 classic game Super Smash Bros. We frame our learning task as a 30-class classification problem, and our CNN model achieves 80\% top-1 and 95\% top-3 validation accuracy. With slight test-time fine-tuning, our model is also competitive during live simulation with the highest-level AI built into the game. We will further show evidence through network visualizations that the network is successfully leveraging temporal information during inference to aid in decision making. Our work demonstrates that supervised CNN models can provide good performance in challenging policy prediction tasks while being significantly simpler and more lightweight than alternatives.},

We investigate how factors such as training data size, training corpus (e.g. Brown vs. Wall Street Journal), count cutoffs, and n-gram order (bigram vs. trigram) affect the relative performance of these methods, which is measured through the cross-entropy of test data. We find that these factors can significantly affect the relative performance of models, with the most significant factor being training data size. Since no previous comparisons have examined these factors systematically, this is the first thorough characterization of the relative performance of various algorithms. In addition, we introduce methodologies for analyzing smoothing algorithm efficacy in detail, and using these techniques we motivate a novel variation of Kneser\textendash Ney smoothing that consistently outperforms all other algorithms evaluated. Finally, results showing that improved language model smoothing leads to improved speech recognition performance are presented.},

  abstract = {The automated detection of abusive content on social media websites faces a variety of challenges including imbalanced training sets, the identification of an appropriate feature representation and the selection of optimal classifiers. Classifiers such as support vector machines (SVM), combined with bag of words or ngram feature representation, have traditionally dominated in text classification for decades. With the recent emergence of deep learning and word embeddings, an increasing number of researchers have started to focus on deep neural networks. In this paper, our aim is to explore cutting-edge techniques in automated abusive content detection. We use two deep learning approaches: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We apply these to 9 public datasets derived from various social media websites. Firstly, we show that word embeddings pre-trained on the same data source as the subsequent classification task improves the prediction accuracy of deep learning models. Secondly, we investigate the impact of different levels of training set imbalances on classifier types. In comparison to the traditional SVM classifier, we identify that although deep learning models can outperform the classification results of the traditional SVM classifier when the associated training dataset is seriously imbalanced, the performance of the SVM classifier can be dramatically improved through the use of oversampling, surpassing the deep learning models. Our work can inform researchers in selecting appropriate text classification strategies in the detection of abusive content, including scenarios where the training datasets suffer from class imbalance.},

For dialogue systems, deep learning can leverage a massive amount of data to learn meaningful feature representations and response generation strategies, while requiring a minimum amount of hand-crafting. In this article, we give an overview to these recent advances on dialogue systems from various perspectives and discuss some possible research directions. In particular, we generally divide existing dialogue systems into task-oriented and nontask-oriented models, then detail how deep learning techniques help them with representative algorithms and finally discuss some appealing research directions that can bring the dialogue system research into a new frontier.},

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the proper-ties of the neural machine translation us-ing two models; RNN Encoder\textendash Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive con-volutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance de-grades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words in-crease. Furthermore, we find that the pro-posed gated recursive convolutional net-work learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

  abstract = {Masked language modeling (MLM) pre-training methods such as BERT corrupt the input by replacing some tokens with [MASK] and then train a model to reconstruct the original tokens. While they produce good results when transferred to downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a more sample-efficient pre-training task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale, where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when using the same amount of compute.},

  abstract = {As machines take over more tasks previously done by humans, artistic creation is also considered as a candidate to be automated. But, can machines create art? This paper offers a conceptual framework for a philosophical discussion of this question regarding the status of machine art and machine creativity. It breaks the main question down in three sub-questions, and then analyses each question in order to arrive at more precise problems with regard to machine art and machine creativity: What is art creation? What do we mean by art? And, what do we mean by machines create art? This then provides criteria we can use to discuss the main question in relation to particular cases. In the course of the analysis, the paper engages with theory in aesthetics, refers to literature on computational creativity, and contributes to the philosophy of technology and philosophical anthropology by reflecting on the role of technology in art creation. It is shown that the distinctions between process versus outcome criteria and subjective versus objective criteria of creativity are unstable. It is also argued that we should consider non-human forms of creativity, and not only cases where either humans or machines create art but also collaborations between humans and machines, which makes us reflect on human-technology relations. Finally, the paper questions the very approach that seeks criteria and suggests that the artistic status of machines may be shown and revealed in the human/non-human encounter before any theorizing or agreement takes place; an experience which then is presupposed when we theorize. This hints at a more general model of what happens in artistic perception and engagement as a hybrid human-technological and emergent or even poetic process, a model which leaves more room for letting ourselves be surprised by creativity\textemdash human and perhaps non-human.},

Our proposals include a specific program to introduce in schools, one that will engage students to discourage cyberbullying. This is accompanied by a few distinct approaches for analyzing data within online social networks, which may help to identify potential victims and bullies, resulting in additional insights for students. We discuss as well other parties who can partner with educational institutions in curtailing cyberbullying, notably ones who can assist in providing safer social networking environments. We conclude with a reflection on the responsibility of all individuals, learning from student years through to adulthood, inspired by lessons revealed from our reflections on this important topic.},

We suggest a simple framework within which the behaviour of a program can be categorised and described which may add to the perception of creativity in the system.},

We hypothesise that, in certain contexts where creative software has increased or total autonomy, lack of authenticity will be a major limiting factor for creative systems in the arts and possibly elsewhere. After explaining and motivating this hypothesis, we study notions of authenticity in the human context and use this to raise issues of computational authenticity. We propose a number of ways to address these issues, including influencing public perception of creative software, practical approaches to software recording and using its life experiences, and employing alternative methodologies for building creative systems. We believe that identifying, exploring and addressing issues of authenticity will help to maximise the beneficial contributions that autonomously creative software can bring to society.},

Data were collected via semi\textendash structured interviews with 11 children aged between seven and 14 years from four paediatric units in England. The children identified a range of fears and concerns, which included: separation from parents and family; unfamiliar environment; investigations and treatments; and loss of self\textendash determination. The children's loss of self\textendash determination over personal needs exacerbated their fears and concerns. It needs to be recognized that compliance with hospital routines is a variable, which influences children's reaction to hospitalization. The findings clearly indicate that children need adequate information tailored to their needs, that their views are sought in the planning and delivery of their care and that hospital environments need to be made more child\textendash centred. Interventions designed to reduce children's stress during hospitalization are not only likely to decrease their stress at the time, but also likely to influence how future experiences are appraised and managed.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

  abstract = {Applications which make use of natural language processing (NLP) are said to benefit more from incorporating a rich model of text meaning than from a basic representation in the form of bag-of-words. This thesis set out to explore the added value of incorporating deep semantic information in two end-user applications that normally rely mostly on superficial and lexical information, viz. readability prediction and aspect-based sentiment analysis. For both applications we apply supervised machine learning techniques and focus on the incorporation of coreference and semantic role information. To this purpose, we adapted a Dutch coreference resolution system and developed a semantic role labeler for Dutch. We tested the cross-genre robustness of both systems and in a next phase retrained them on a large corpus comprising a variety of text genres.  For the readability prediction task, we first built a general-purpose corpus consisting of a large variety of text genres which was then assessed on readability. Moreover, we proposed an assessment technique which has not previously been used in readability assessment, namely crowdsourcing, and revealed that crowdsourcing is a viable alternative to the more traditional assessment technique of having experts assign labels. We built the first state-of-the-art classification-based readability prediction system relying on a rich feature space of traditional, lexical, syntactic and shallow semantic features. Furthermore, we enriched this tool by introducing new features based on coreference resolution and semantic role labeling. We then explored the added value of incorporating this deep semantic information by performing two different rounds of experiments. In the first round these features were manually in- or excluded and in the second round joint optimization experiments were performed using a wrapper-based feature selection system based on genetic algorithms. In both setups, we investigated whether there was a difference in performance when these features were derived from gold standard information compared to when they were automatically generated, which allowed us to assess the true upper bound of incorporating this type of information. Our results revealed that readability classification definitely benefits from the incorporation of semantic information in the form of coreference and semantic role features. More precisely, we found that the best results for both tasks were achieved after jointly optimizing the hyperparameters and semantic features using genetic algorithms. Contrary to our expectations, we observed that our system achieved its best performance when relying on the automatically predicted deep semantic features. This is an interesting result, as our ultimate goal is to predict readability based exclusively on automatically-derived information sources.  For the aspect-based sentiment analysis task, we developed the first Dutch end-to-end system. We therefore collected a corpus of Dutch restaurant reviews and annotated each review with aspect term expressions and polarity. For the creation of our system, we distinguished three individual subtasks: aspect term extraction, aspect category classification and aspect polarity classification. We then investigated the added value of our two semantic information layers in the second subtask of aspect category classification.  In a first setup, we focussed on investigating the added value of performing coreference resolution prior to classification in order to derive which implicit aspect terms (anaphors) could be linked to which explicit aspect terms (antecedents). In these experiments, we explored how the performance of a baseline classifier relying on lexical information alone would benefit from additional semantic information in the form of lexical-semantic and semantic role features. We hypothesized that if coreference resolution was performed prior to classification, more of this semantic information could be derived, i.e. for the implicit aspect terms, which would result in a better performance. In this respect, we optimized our classifier using a wrapper-based approach for feature selection and we compared a setting where we relied on gold-standard anaphor-antecedent pairs to a setting where these had been predicted.  Our results revealed a very moderate performance gain and underlined that incorporating coreference information only proves useful when integrating gold-standard coreference annotations. When coreference relations were derived automatically, this led to an overall decrease in performance because of semantic mismatches. When comparing the semantic role to the lexical-semantic features, it seemed that especially the latter features allow for a better performance. In a second setup, we investigated how to resolve implicit aspect terms. We compared a setting where gold-standard coreference resolution was used for this purpose to a setting where the implicit aspects were derived from a simple subjectivity heuristic. Our results revealed that using this heuristic results in a better coverage and performance, which means that, overall, it was difficult to find an added value in resolving coreference first.  Does deep semantic information help tip the scales on performance? For Dutch readability prediction, we found that it does, when integrated in a state-of-the-art classifier. By using such information for Dutch aspect-based sentiment analysis, we found that this approach adds weight to the scales, but cannot make them tip.},

Since its introduction by Gartner nearly two decades ago, the model has received growing interest from practitioners, and more recently from scholars. Given the model's proclaimed capacity to forecast technological development, an important consideration for organizations in formulating marketing strategies, this paper provides a critical review of the hype cycle model by seeking evidence from Gartner's own technology databases for the manifestation of hype cycles. The results of our empirical work show incongruences connected with the reports of Gartner, which motivates us to consider possible future directions, whereby the notion of hype or hyped dynamics (though not necessarily the hype cycle model itself) can be captured in existing life cycle models through the identification of peak, disappointment, and recovery patterns.},

  abstract = {The twofold aim of this study was to substantiate the validity of the Self-Regulation Questionnaire-Reading Motivation and Self-Regulation Questionnaire-Writing Motivation for third to eight graders and to map motivational trends in elementary and secondary education students' academic and recreational reading and writing. More specifically, we adopted the innovative and coherent theoretical framework of the Self-Determination Theory to study qualitatively different motives for reading and writing and to examine the relationships between them. In total, 2,343 students from third to eighth grade were involved. Based on confirmatory factor analyses, a two-factor model, distinguishing between autonomous and controlled motivation, for academic and recreational reading and writing was confirmed in all grades. Furthermore, the scales were reliable, and the measurement models were invariant across students' gender and their general achievement level. Despite the absence of strong invariance for the measurement models across each of the different grades, we found evidence that students within the same grade level (i.e., middle elementary, upper elementary, and lower secondary grade) interpreted the SRQ-Reading and Writing scale items in a conceptually similar way. Factor correlations confirmed the interrelatedness of reading and writing motives, as well as strong associations between students' motivation to read and write in either academic and recreational contexts. Finally, concerning the motivational trends, the present results advert to a significant decline of students' autonomous motivation to read and write, both in and outside school. Accordingly, we point out that the late elementary and the lower secondary grades are crucial phases to engage students in motivating literacy activities. In light of these alarming results, we recommend future experimental research studies to focus on evaluating the effectiveness of instructional reading and writing activities that foster students' innate need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.},

A CBR process is defined to generate plots from a user query specifying an initial setting for the story, using an ontology to measure the semantical distance between words and structures taking part in the texts.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \textbackslash AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction. \textcopyright{} 1990.},

  abstract = {The detection of online cyberbullying has seen an increase in societal importance, popularity in research, and available open data. Nevertheless, while computational power and affordability of resources continue to increase, the access restrictions on high-quality data limit the applicability of state-of-the-art techniques. Consequently, much of the recent research uses small, heterogeneous datasets, without a thorough evaluation of applicability. In this paper, we further illustrate these issues, as we (i) evaluate many publicly available resources for this task and demonstrate difficulties with data collection. These predominantly yield small datasets that fail to capture the required complex social dynamics and impede direct comparison of progress. We (ii) conduct an extensive set of experiments that indicate a general lack of cross-domain generalization of classifiers trained on these sources, and openly provide this framework to replicate and extend our evaluation criteria. Finally, we (iii) present an effective crowdsourcing method: simulating real-life bullying scenarios in a lab setting generates plausible data that can be effectively used to enrich real data. This largely circumvents the restrictions on data that can be collected, and increases classifier performance. We believe these contributions can aid in improving the empirical practices of future research in the field.},

Following this search, they reviewed each study and documented the language sampling procedures reported. The authors' synthesis revealed that approximately 25\% of all child-focused studies use language samples to help characterize participants and/or derive dependent variables. They found remarkable inconsistencies in the reporting of language sampling procedures.},

I derived a set of merge rules from descriptions given by Propp. These rules, when coupled with a modified version of the model merging learning framework, reproduce Propp's functions well. Three important function groups--namely A/a (villainy/lack), H/I (struggle and victory), and W (reward)--are identified with high accuracies. This is the first demonstration of a computational system learning a real theory of narrative structure.},

  abstract = {A considerable body of research deals with the automatic identification of hate speech and related phenomena. However, cross-dataset model generalization remains a challenge. In this context, we address two still open central questions: (i) to what extent does the generalization depend on the model and the composition and annotation of the training data in terms of different categories?, and (ii) do specific features of the datasets or models influence the generalization potential? To answer (i), we experiment with BERT, ALBERT, fastText, and SVM models trained on nine common public English datasets, whose class (or category) labels are standardized (and thus made comparable), in intra- and cross-dataset setups. The experiments show that indeed the generalization varies from model to model and that some of the categories (e.g., `toxic', `abusive', or `offensive') serve better as cross-dataset training categories than others (e.g., `hate speech'). To answer (ii), we use a Random Forest model for assessing the relevance of different model and dataset features during the prediction of the performance of 450 BERT, 450 ALBERT, 450 fastText, and 348 SVM binary abusive language classifiers (1698 in total). We find that in order to generalize well, a model already needs to perform well in an intra-dataset scenario. Furthermore, we find that some other parameters are equally decisive for the success of the generalization, including, e.g., the training and target categories and the percentage of the out-of-domain vocabulary.},

Although most patients were receiving several drugs, Mellaril (thioridazine) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine (chlorpromazine). Aventyl (nortriptyline) and Elavil (amitriptyline) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman. Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients. The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one. The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped. Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease. Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs. A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose three different ways of using IMS Learning Design to support online adaptive learning modules that include educational videogames. The first approach relies on IMS LD to support adaptation procedures where the educational games are considered as Learning Objects. These games can be included instead of traditional content to adapt the learning experience to the preferences of the student. In the second approach, the game engine supports the entire adaptation cycle, simply using IMS LD as a delivery mechanism for the packages containing the games. The learner profile is used to adapt the game, and the activity within the game is used to adjust the profile. Finally, the third approach stands between the other two, using IMS LD to model the general adaptation guidelines and then refining the adaptation inside the games. We illustrate these approaches with the \&lt;e-Adventure\&gt; educational game engine, which includes the mechanisms required to support these adaptation cycles.Editors: Daniel Burgos.},

  abstract = {The present paper presents an application that composes formal poetry in Spanish in a semiautomatic interactive fashion. Automatic Spanish Poetry Expert and Rewriting Application (ASPERA) is a forward reasoning rule-based system that obtains from the user basic style parameters and an intended message; applies a knowledge-based pre-processor to select the most appropriate metric structure for the user's wishes; and, by intelligent adaptation of selected examples from a corpus of verses, carries out a prose-to-poetry translation of the given message. In the composition process, ASPERA combines natural language generation and CBR techniques to apply a set of construction heuristics obtained from formal literature on Spanish poetry. If the user validates the poem draft presented by the system, the resulting verses are analysed and incorporated into the system data files.},

  abstract = {Human verbal communication includes affective messages which are conveyed through use of emotionally colored words. There has been a lot of research in this direction but the problem of integrating state-of-the-art neural language models with affective information remains an area ripe for exploration. In this paper, we propose an extension to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) language model for generating conversational text, conditioned on affect categories. Our proposed model, Affect-LM enables us to customize the degree of emotional content in generated sentences through an additional design parameter. Perception studies conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk show that Affect-LM generates naturally looking emotional sentences without sacrificing grammatical correctness. Affect-LM also learns affect-discriminative word representations, and perplexity experiments show that additional affective information in conversational text can improve language model prediction.},

Included are the physician and general practitioner focus group - a much sought-after segment for market research in the 1990's by drug companies; and what to do about the persistent weaknesses in the focus group process caused by ineffective management of field services, unacceptable recruiting, lack of thoroughness in rescreening and lack of professionalism in general.},

Today's social media landscape is littered with unfiltered content that can be anywhere from slightly abusive to hate inducing. In response, we focused on training a multi-label classifier to detect both the type and level of toxicity in online content. This content is typically colloquial and conversational in style. Its classification therefore requires huge amounts of annotated data due to its variability and inconsistency. We compare standard methods of text classification in this task. A conventional one-vs-rest SVM classifier with character and word level frequency-based representation of text reaches 0.9763 ROC AUC score. We demonstrated that leveraging more advanced technologies such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, attention mechanism, stacking of classifiers and semi-supervised training can improve the ROC AUC score of classification to 0.9862. We suggest that in order to choose the right model one has to consider the accuracy of models as well as inference complexity based on the application.},

According to the liberal view, the citizen's status is primarily determined according to negative rights they have vis-\~A\textexclamdown -vis the state and other citizens. According to the republican view, the model of negative liberties to which these citizens can lay claim as private persons does not determine the status of citizens. The republican model as compared to the liberal one has the advantage that it preserves the original meaning of democracy in terms of the institutionalization of a public use of reason jointly exercised by autonomous citizens. The third model is communitarian model. According to the communitarian view, there is a necessary connection between the deliberative concept of democracy and the reference to a concrete, substantively integrated ethical community. Discourse theory invests the democratic process with normative connotations stronger than those found in the liberal model but weaker than those of the republican model. Discourse theory altogether jettisons certain premises of the philosophy of consciousness.},

Critical Theorists and International Relations provides a wide-ranging introduction to thirty-two important theorists whose work has been influential in thinking about global politics. Each chapter is written by an expert with a detailed knowledge of the theorist concerned, representing a range of approaches under the rubric critical, including Marxism and post-Marxism, the Frankfurt School, hermeneutics, phenomenology, postcolonialism, feminism, queer theory, poststructuralism, pragmatism, scientific realism, deconstruction and psychoanalysis. Key features of each chapter include: a clear and concise biography of the relevant thinker an introduction to their key writings and ideas a summary of the ways in which these ideas have influenced and are being used in international relations scholarship a list of suggestions for further reading},

  abstract = {from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Cyborg\_Manifesto A Cyborg Manifesto is an essay written by Donna Haraway. Haraway began writing the Manifesto in 1983 to address the Socialist Review request of American socialist feminists to ponder over the future of socialist feminism in the context of the early Reagan era and the decline of leftist politics. The first versions of the essay had a strong socialist and European connection that the Socialist Review East Coast Collective found too controversial to publish. The Berkeley Socialist Review Collective published the essay in 1985 under the editor Jeff Escoffier. The essay is most well known for being published in Donna Haraway's 1991 book Simians, Cyborgs and Women. \$\textbackslash backslash\$nDonna Haraway's essay is an attempt to break away from Oedipal narratives and Christian origin doctrines like Genesis; the concept of the cyborg is a rejection of rigid boundaries, notably those separating "human" from "animal" and "human" from "machine." In A Cyborg Manifesto, she writes: "The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust." \$\textbackslash backslash\$nThe Manifesto criticizes traditional notions of feminism\textemdash particularly its strong emphasis on identity, rather than affinity. She uses the metaphor of a cyborg to urge feminists to move beyond the limitations of traditional gender, feminism, and politics.[2] Marisa Olson summarized Haraway's thoughts as a belief that there is no distinction between natural life and artificial man-made machines.},

EXAMS offers a fine-grained evaluation framework across multiple languages and subjects, which allows precise analysis and comparison of various models. We perform various experiments with existing top-performing multilingual pre-trained models and we show that EXAMS offers multiple challenges that require multilingual knowledge and reasoning in multiple domains. We hope that EXAMS will enable researchers to explore challenging reasoning and knowledge transfer methods and pre-trained models for school question answering in various languages which was not possible before.

Conclusions from such data can be trusted only after demonstrating their reliability. Unfortunately, the content analysis literature is full of proposals for so-called reliability coefficients, leaving investigators easily confused, not knowing which to choose. After describing the criteria for a good measure of reliability, we propose Krippendorff's alpha as the standard reliability measure. It is general in that it can be used regardless of the number of observers, levels of measurement, sample sizes, and presence or absence of missing data. To facilitate the adoption of this recommendation, we describe a freely available macro written for SPSS and SAS to calculate Krippendorff's alpha and illustrate its use with a simple example.},

By pointing out the incompleteness as well as the accomplishment of each, I want to show that together they suggest new interactions between the local and the global and, through these interactions, new possibilities for political awareness and action},

  abstract = {Researchers in artificial intelligence and robotics often include a timeline stretching into the future in which they predict the convergence between human and artificial intelligence. Ray Kurzweil, for example, predicts that in a mere 100 years humans and intelligent machines will become indistinguishable from one another, both ceasing to have permanent corporeal forms. This article argues that the one thing we can know for sure about the future is that when it arrives, it will be different from what we imagined. The cultural work that predictions like Kurzweil's perform is less to prognosticate the future than to shape our understanding of what it means to be human in the present. Working from the `sense-think-act' paradigm foundational to work in artificial intelligence and robotics, this article argues that predictions in all three areas (sensing, thinking, acting) feed back to affect how the human is envisioned in the present. The reconfigurations these predictions bring about are to downplay consciousness, embodied cognition, and evolutionary inertia. The article concludes by critically evaluating contemporary resistances to the posthuman, especially in the writings of Rodney Brooks and Francis Fukuyama.},

Further change is needed to take full advantage of the rich multimedia capabilities offered by contemporary reading and writing practices. The move toward visual rhetoric is a welcome addition to the canon of traditional verbal strategies, but images are only one component among several newadditions to the repertoire of electronic writing. To help our students learn to write effectively in digital media, we need to develop modes of critical attention responsive to the full range of semiotic components that can be used as signifying elements in electronic work, including animation, sound, graphics, screen design, and navigational functionalities. In effect, we must learn to speak digital.},

In Talan Memmott's literary hypertext , subjectivity is the product of recursive cycles be- tween humans and intelligent machines. To develop this vision, Memmott uses a variety of techniques, including an idiosyncratic pseudo-language com- prised of coding expressions combined with Eng- lish words, classical myths rewritten using techno- logical terms and images, and screen designs that invite the reader to understand herself as a perme- able membrane through which information flows. A prominent feature of screen design is occluded text\textemdash words and symbols overwritten with other text so that they are only partially visible. This strategy serves to remind the reader that she is not the only parser of this text; the machine also parses it. In contrast to the partial reading available to the hu- man reader, for the machine all the layers of code are operationally coherent and functionally clear. In this context reading becomes a cyborg activity, a practice that involves both human and non-human cognisers.},

  abstract = {Lulled into somnolence by five hundred years of print, literary analysis should awaken to the importance of media-specific analysis, a mode of critical attention which recognizes that all texts are instantiated and that the nature of the medium in which they are instantiated matters. Central to repositioning critical inquiry, so it can attend to the specificity of the medium, is a more robust notion of materiality. Materiality is reconceptualized as the interplay between a text's physical characteristics and its signifying strategies, a move that entwines instantiation and signification at the outset. This definition opens the possibility of considering texts as embodied entities while still maintaining a central focus on interpretation. It makes materiality an emergent property, so that it cannot be specified in advance, as if it were a pregiven entity. Rather, materiality is open to debate and interpretation, ensuring that discussions about the text's`` meaning'' will also take into account its physical specificity as well.\$\textbackslash backslash\$nFollowing the emphasis on media-specific analysis, nine points can be made about the specificities of electronic hypertext: they are dynamic images; they include both analogue resemblance and digital coding; they are generated through fragmentation and recombination; they have depth and operate in three dimensions; they are written in code as well as natural language; they are mutable and transformable; they are spaces to navigate; they are written and read in distributed cognitive environments; and they initiate and demand cyborg reading practices.},

Activated by the appropriate receiver, they transmit information ranging from product information such as manufacturing date, delivery route, and location where the item was purchased to (in the case of credit cards) the name, address, and credit history of the person holding the card. Active RFIDs have the capacity to transmit data without having to be activated by a receiver; they can be linked with embedded sensors to allow continuous monitoring of environmental conditions, applications that interest both environmental groups and the US military. The amount of information accessible through and generated by RFIDs is so huge that it may well overwhelm all existing data sources and become, from the viewpoint of human time limitations, essentially infinite. What to make of these technologies will be interrogated through two contemporary fictions, David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas and Philip K. Dick's Ubik . Cloud Atlas focuses on epistemological questions \textemdash{} who knows what about whom, in a futuristic society where all citizens wear embedded RFID tags and are subject to constant surveillance. Resistance takes the form not so much of evasion (tactical moves in a complex political Situation) but rather as a struggle to transmit information to present and future stakeholders in a world on the brink of catastrophe. Ubik, by contrast, focuses on deeper ontological questions about the nature of reality itself. Both texts point to the necessity to reconceptualize information as ethical action embedded in contexts and not merely as a quantitative measure of probabilities.},

From this changed perception of the relation between order and disorder flow multiple implications. The most important for Serres's project derives from formal results within information theory that demonstrated noise in a communication channel need not always destructively interfere with the message, but rather could itself become part of the message. To explain how noise could be seen as a positive rather than a negative quantity, I will need to review briefly Claude Shannon's theory of in- formation (Shannon},

While Haraway has turned from a central focus on technoculture to companion species, much important cultural work remains to be done, especially in networked and programmable media. Problems with the cyborg as a metaphor include the implication that the liberal humanist subject, however problematized by its hybridization with cybernetic mechanism, continues as a singular entity operating with localized agency. In a word, the cyborg is not networked enough to encompass the emergent possibilities associated with the Internet and the world-wide web and other phenomena of the contemporary digital era. Instead I propose the idea of the cognisphere. As operational concept and suggestive metaphor, the cognisphere recognizes that networked and programmable media are not only more pervasive than ever before in human history but also more cognitively powerful. It is closely associated with what many researchers regard as a major insight: the idea that the physical world is fundamentally computational. While these scientists regard computation as a physical process, the cultural critic is apt to see it as an over-determined metaphor. The binary choice between seeing the computational universe as a literal description of the physical world and reading it as an over-determined metaphor misses a crucial aspect of contemporary cultural dynamics: the interaction between means and metaphor, technology and cultural presupposition. Taking this dynamic into account leads to a more complete understanding summed up in the aphorism, `What we make and what (we think) we are co-evolve together.'},

  abstract = {What does it mean to be human today? The answer to this question, which is as old as the human species itself, is becoming less and less certain. Current technological developments increasingly erode our traditional humanist reflexes: consciousness, emotion, language, intelligence, morality, humour, mortality - all these no longer demonstrate the unique character and value of human existence. Instead, the spectre of the 'posthuman' is now being widely invoked as the 'inevitable' next evolutionary stage that humans are facing.Who comes after the human? This is the question that posthumanists are taking as their starting point. This critical introduction understands posthumanism as a discourse, which, in principle, includes everything that has been and is being said about the figure of the 'posthuman'. It outlines the genealogy of the various posthuman 'scenarios' in circulation and engages with their theoretical and philosophical assumptions and social and political implications. It does so by connecting the philosophical debate about the future of humanity with a range of texts, including examples from new media, popular culture, science and the media.},

Our inclusion of the word ``community'' here is deliberate: what is controversial to some audiences may not be so to others. Using data from several different communities on reddit.com, we predict the ultimate controversiality of posts, leveraging features drawn from both the textual content and the tree structure of the early comments that initiate the discussion. We find that even when only a handful of comments are available, e.g., the first 5 comments made within 15 minutes of the original post, discussion features often add predictive capacity to strong content-andrate only baselines. Additional experiments on domain transfer suggest that conversationstructure features often generalize to other communities better than conversation-content features do.},

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete time steps by enforcing constant error through \textbackslash constant error carrousels" within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artiicial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with RTRL, BPTT, Recurrent Cascade-Correlation, Elman nets, and Neural Sequence Chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artiicial long time lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Because of this property recurrent nets are used in time series prediction and process control. Practical applications involve temporal dependencies spanning many time steps, e.g. between relevant inputs and desired outputs. In this case, however, gradient based learning methods take too much time. The extremely increased learning time arises because the error vanishes as it gets propagated back. In this article the de-caying error flow is theoretically analyzed. Then methods trying to overcome vanishing gradients are briefly discussed. Finally, experiments comparing conventional algorithms and alternative methods are presented. With advanced methods long time lag problems can be solved in reasonable time.},

  abstract = {Paul Virilio is one of the most significant and original thinkers to emerge in the latter half of the twentieth century. His work is fundamentally concerned with questions of perception and embodiment, but also with questions of social and political development. He engages in a sustained manner with a very wide range of issues: with questions of war and military strategy, with the history of cinema, the nature of modern media and telecommunications, and with the state of contemporary cultural and artistic production. The astonishing breadth of his thinking makes him an indispensable point of reference for a wide range of disciplines. His work touches on politics, international relations theory and war studies, on media and social theory, aesthetics, urbanism and environmental thinking.Within this broad range of concerns the question of technology has played a central and determining role. If Virilio is an indispensable contemporary thinker it is perhaps because his work is rooted in a sustained philosophical engagement with the question of technology. Virilio's work shows us how and why technology has been, and will continue to be, fundamental to the shaping of human experience and historical development.},

This thesis ignores the possibility that swearing can be advantageous, cathartic, or an acceptable substitute for physical aggression. Observational data, courtroom evidence and verbal abuse research reviewed here produce conflicting conclusions on the question of harm. The best evidence of harm resides in harassment and OTC studies, but verbal abuse research is indeterminate because of flawed research methodology. Public swearing research reveals that swearing is a common conversational practice resulting in no obvious harm. ``Common sense'' (folk psychology) views of swearing are mistaken and inadequate for some decisions regarding harm. Meanwhile, efforts to restrict speech in media and instructional settings continue, despite the lack of a convincing need to do so. Harm from offensive speech is contextually determined; therefore attempts to restrict speech on a universal basis are misguided. Psychologists' research needs to be informed by public policy and courtroom practices, and public policy and litigation need to be better informed by psychologists' research.},

Our method tests whether systems can answer questions about paragraphs that contain adversarially inserted sentences, which are automatically generated to distract computer systems without changing the correct answer or misleading humans. In this adversarial setting, the accuracy of sixteen published models drops from an average of \$75\textbackslash\%\$ F1 score to \$36\textbackslash\%\$; when the adversary is allowed to add ungrammatical sequences of words, average accuracy on four models decreases further to \$7\textbackslash\%\$. We hope our insights will motivate the development of new models that understand language more precisely.},

It provides theoretical and practical approaches to identifying, structuring and resolving some of the key issues in the debate about the nature of research in the arts which have surfaced during the establishment of this subject over the last decade.Contributions are located in the contemporary intellectual environment of research in the arts, and more widely in the universities, in the strategic and political environment of national research funding, and in the international environment of trans-national cooperation and communication. The book is divided into three principal sections Foundations, Voices and Contexts each with an introduction from the editors highlighting the main issues, agreements and debates in each section.The Routledge Companion to Research in the Arts addresses a wide variety of concepts and issues, including:the diversity of views on what constitutes arts-based research and scholarship, what it should be, and its potential contributionthe trans-national communication difficulties arising from terminological and ontological differences in arts-based researchtraditional and non-traditional concepts of knowledge, their relationship to professional practice, and their outcomes and audiencesa consideration of the role of written, spoken and artefact-based languages in the formation and communication of understandings.This comprehensive collection makes an original and significant contribution to the field of arts-based research by setting down a framework for addressing these, and other, topical issues. It will be essential reading for research managers and policy-makers in research councils and universities, as well as individual researchers, research supervisors and doctoral candidates.},

  abstract = {Effects of sodium nitrate were compared with sodium chloride loading on transport of electrolytes by the nephron. Maximal levels of free water clearance/clomerular filtration rate (CH2O/GFR) averaged 8.4\% with nitrate loading and 14.4\% with saline loading. Since ethacrynic acid and chlorothiazide exert their major natriuretic effect in the distal nephron, the increment in Na ad Cl reabsorbed beyond the proximal tubule. The administration of these agents resulted in an increase in fractional sodium excretion (CNa/GFR) of 21.1\%, urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) of 1,126 mueq/min, and urinary chloride excretion (UClV) of 848 mueq/min during nitrate loading compared with an increase in CNa/GFR of 37.6\%, UNaV of 2,362 mueq/min, and UClV of 2,397 mueq/min during saline loading. The smaller diuretic-induced increment in Na and Cl excretion in the nitrate studies suggests, as do the hydrated studies, that less Cl and Na are reabsorbed in the distal nephron during nitrate than saline loading. At every level of UNaV, fractional bicarbonate reabsorption was higher, urine pH was lower, and urinary potassium excretion (UKV) was higher in the nitrate studies. Thus, compared with saline loading, sodium nitrate decreases chloride and sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron. The higher hydrogen and potassium secretion in the nitrate studies may be consequent to the decreased ability of the distal nephron to reabsorb chloride.},

  abstract = {Depthwise separable convolutions reduce the number of parameters and computation used in convolutional operations while increasing representational efficiency. They have been shown to be successful in image classification models, both in obtaining better models than previously possible for a given parameter count (the Xception architecture) and considerably reducing the number of parameters required to perform at a given level (the MobileNets family of architectures). Recently, convolutional sequence-to-sequence networks have been applied to machine translation tasks with good results. In this work, we study how depthwise separable convolutions can be applied to neural machine translation. We introduce a new architecture inspired by Xception and ByteNet, called SliceNet, which enables a significant reduction of the parameter count and amount of computation needed to obtain results like ByteNet, and, with a similar parameter count, achieves new state-of-the-art results. In addition to showing that depthwise separable convolutions perform well for machine translation, we investigate the architectural changes that they enable: we observe that thanks to depthwise separability, we can increase the length of convolution windows, removing the need for filter dilation. We also introduce a new "super-separable" convolution operation that further reduces the number of parameters and computational cost for obtaining state-of-the-art results.},

In the U.S., stand-up acts are comprised of solo comedian's narrative performance, while stand-up comic narrative in Japan is performed in the form of dialogue between two comedians. The study conducts a micro-level discourse analysis of live performances by two U.S. comedians and two Japanese comedy duos. Humor in U.S. stand-up emerges through common ground between the comedian and the audience, whereas the Japanese comedians communicate humor on the basis of the boundary between their performance sphere and the audience's spectator sphere. The boundary markings are further analyzed based on indexical inclusion and exclusion (Strauss \& Eun 2005).},

  abstract = {AIM: This paper reports a study that explored whether active engagement and group interaction could be captured in an online environment. BACKGROUND: Focus groups have become a common means of capitalizing on group interaction to collect rich responses to questions posed. Whilst their use is well established in the repertoire of qualitative researchers, with changing technology there is the opportunity to use a computer program that facilitates online engagement and interaction to bring together a group of people to explore issues, attitudes and perceptions. METHOD: Using a qualitative descriptive method and purposive sampling, 38 Australian Enrolled Nurses participated in an online focus group. WebCT, a program that facilitates online engagement and interaction, was used to enable participants to interact from any computer, from any location, at any time. FINDINGS: The experience of conducting an online focus group was a positive one. Advantages such as cost savings and convenience for both researcher and participants were identified. This study demonstrated that participants could be actively engaged over a 2-month period and that group interaction could be achieved to collect richly detailed research data. CONCLUSION: Whilst online focus groups may not be suitable in every situation, the potential exists to capitalize on technology to bring together a group of people separated by distance in an online environment that encourages interactive discussion.},

  abstract = {Children's and adolescents' social reasoning about exclusion was assessed in 3 different social contexts. 294 subjects (Ss) at 3 ages, 10 yrs (4th grade), 13.7 yrs (7th grade), and 16.2 yrs (10th grade), fairly evenly divided by gender, from 4 ethnic groups, European-American (n = 109), African American (n = 96), and a combined sample of Asian-American and Latin-American Ss (n = 89) were interviewed regarding their social reasoning about exclusion based on group membership, gender, and race. The contexts for exclusion were friendship, peer, and school. Significant patterns of reasoning about exclusion were found for the context, the target of exclusion, and the degree to which social influence, authority expectations, and cultural norms explained children's judgments. There were also differences depending on the gender, age, and ethnicity of the Ss. The findings support the theoretical proposal that exclusion is a multi-faceted phenomenon and that different forms of reasoning are brought to bear on the issue. The results contribute to an understanding of the factors involved in the developmental emergence of judgments about exclusion based on group membership as well as to the phenomena of prejudice, discrimination, and the fair treatment of others.

Despite the fact that Mycin outperformed members of the Stanford medical school in the reliability of diagnosis it was never used in practice due to a legal issue who do you sue if it gives a wrong diagnosis?. However only in 2016 when the artificial intelligence software built into the IBM Watson AI platform correctly diagnosed and proposed an effective treatment for a 60-year-old womans rare form of leukemia the AI use in medicine become really popular.On of first papers presenting the use of AI in paediatrics was published in 1984.

The focus group method and its background are presented, the method's weaknesses and strengths are discussed, and guidelines are provided for how to use the method in the software engineering context. Furthermore, the results of the three studies conducted are highlighted and the paper concludes in a discussion on the applicability of the method for this type of research. In summary, the focus group method is a cost-effective and quick empirical research approach for obtaining qualitative insights and feedback from practitioners. It can be used in several phases and types of research. However, a major limitation of the method is that it is useful only in studying concepts that can be understood by participants in a limited time. We also recommend that in the software engineering context, the method should be used with sufficient empirical rigor.},

  abstract = {Text classification is a foundational task in many NLP applications. Traditional text classifiers often rely on many human-designed features, such as dictionaries, knowledge bases and special tree kernels. In contrast to traditional methods, we introduce a recurrent convolutional neural network for text classification without human-designed features. In our model, we apply a recurrent structure to capture contextual information as far as possible when learning word representations, which may introduce considerably less noise compared to traditional window-based neural networks. We also employ a max-pooling layer that automatically judges which words play key roles in text classification to capture the key components in texts. We conduct experiments on four commonly used datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, particularly on document-level datasets.},

However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations and longer training times. To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a self-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and \textbackslash squad benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.

When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, ``powerful,'' ``strong'' and ``Paris'' are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-ofwords models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

In this paper, we investigate whether socially assistive robots in role-playing settings are as effective with small groups of children as they are with a single child, and whether individual factors such as gender, grade level (first vs. second), perception of the robots (peer vs. adult), and empathy level (low vs. high) play a role in these two interaction contexts. We conducted a three-week repeated exposure experiment where 40 children interacted with socially assistive robotic characters that acted out interactive stories around words that contribute to expanding children's emotional vocabulary. Our results showed that although participants who interacted alone with the robots recalled the stories better than participants in the group condition, no significant differences were found in children's emotional interpretation of the narratives. With regard to individual differences, we found that a single child setting appeared more appropriate to first graders than a group setting, empathy level is an important predictor for emotional understanding of the narratives, and children's performance varies depending on their perception of the robots (peer vs. adult) in the two conditions.},

Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes, and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our models and code.},

  abstract = {The question as to whether creativity is domain general or domain specific is one of the most enduring and controversial topics in the field. Yet the importance or relevance of the chosen application domain has not been considered in the related field of computational creativity (CC). A recent study at ICCC demonstrated that the range of applications considered in the study of CC has been diverse with more novel topics being considered as the field progresses (Loughran and O'Neill 2017a). As the field grows, we propose that we need to consider the relevance of the application domain and any potential role or effect the choice of the domain may have on the outcome of the designed system. In this paper, we review what it means for CC to be domain-general. We consider the domain-dependence of creativity in human studies and what implications, if any, may arise from the choice of application domain in CC studies. We conclude that this is a multi-faceted question and that a simple yes or no answer may not be possible to acquire or sensible to suggest.},

  abstract = {An attentional mechanism has lately been used to improve neural machine translation (NMT) by selectively focusing on parts of the source sentence during translation. However, there has been little work exploring useful architectures for attention-based NMT. This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches over the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures has established a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT'15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.},

  abstract = {Most previous work on trainable language generation has focused on two paradigms: (a) using a generation decisions of an existing generator. Both approaches rely on the existence of a handcrafted generation component, which is likely to limit their scalability to new domains. The first contribution of this article is to present Bagel, a fully data-driven generation method that treats the language generation task as a search for the most likely sequence of semantic concepts and realization phrases, according to Factored Language Models (FLMs). As domain utterances are not readily available for most natural language generation tasks, a large creative effort is required to produce the data necessary to represent human linguistic variation for nontrivial domains. This article is based on the assumption that learning to produce paraphrases can be facilitated by collecting data from a large sample of untrained annotators using crowdsourcing\textemdash rather than a few domain experts\textemdash by relying on a coarse meaning representation. A second contribution of this article is to use crowdsourced data to show how dialogue naturalness can be improved by learning to vary the output utterances generated for a given semantic input. Two data-driven methods for generating paraphrases in dialogue are presented: (a) by sampling from the n-best list of realizations produced by Bagel's FLM reranker; and (b) by learning a structured perceptron predicting whether candidate realizations are valid paraphrases. We train Bagel on a set of 1,956 utterances produced by 137 annotators, which covers 10 types of dialogue acts and 128 semantic concepts in a tourist information system for Cambridge. An automated evaluation shows that Bagel outperforms utterance class LM baselines on this domain. A human evaluation of 600 resynthesized dialogue extracts shows that Bagel's FLM output produces utterances comparable to a handcrafted baseline, whereas the perceptron classifier performs worse. Interestingly, human judges find the system sampling from the n-best list to be more natural than a system always returning the first-best utterance. The judges are also more willing to interact with the n-best system in the future. These results suggest that capturing the large variation found in human language using data-driven methods is beneficial for dialogue interaction.},

  abstract = {Poetry is a unique artifact of the human language faculty, with its defining feature being a strong unity between content and form. Contrary to the opinion that the automatic generation of poetry is a relatively easy task, we argue that it is in fact an extremely difficult task that requires intelligence, world and linguistic knowledge, and creativity. We propose a model of poetry generation as a state space search problem, where a goal state is a text that satisfies the three properties of meaningfulness, grammaticality, and poeticness. We argue that almost all existing work on poetry generation only properly addresses a subset of these properties. In designing a computational approach for solving this problem, we draw upon the wealth of work in natural language generation (NLG). Although the emphasis of NLG research is on the generation of informative texts, recent work has highlighted the need for more flexible models which can be cast as one end of a spectrum of search sophistication, where the opposing end is the deterministically goal-directed planning of traditional NLG. We propose satisfying the properties of poetry through the application to NLG of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), a wellstudied heuristic search method. MCGONAGALL is our implemented instance of this approach. We use a linguistic representation based on Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) that we argue is appropriate for EA-based NLG. Several genetic operators are implemented, ranging from baseline operators based on LTAG syntactic operations to heuristic semantic goal-directed operators. Two evaluation functions are implemented: one that measures the isomorphism between a solution's stress pattern and a target metre using the edit distance algorithm, and one that measures the isomorphism between a solution's propositional semantics and a target semantics using structural similarity metrics. We conducted an empirical study using MCGONAGALL to test the validity of employing EAs in solving the search problem, and to test whether our evaluation functions adequately capture the notions of semantic and metrical faithfulness. We conclude that our use of EAs offers an innovative approach to flexible NLG, as demonstrated by its successful application to the poetry generation task.},

  abstract = {Ubiquity of the Internet and wide adoption of the computing and mobile devices is driving explosion of data. Interestingly, cybercriminals are also leveraging these popular technologies to cash in on cybercrime in form of scams, fraud and fake online reviews. Existing content filtering techniques, which have been successful in containing spam, are failing to filter these new types of cybercrime because cybercriminals generate text messages to bypass content filters. In this paper, we use natural language processing and a deception-detection discourse to build hybrid models for detecting these forms of text-based cybercrime. Since we have four datasets each of which contains deceptive text messages representing a specific type of cybercrime and truthful text messages, we combine 2 datasets and 3 datasets together to generate training sets for the hybrid models with more than one type of cybercrime. The hybrid cybercrime detection models are trained using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Na\"ive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and kth Nearest Neighbor (kNN). The models are then evaluated on test sets containing instances that were not part of the training sets. The results for model performance of NB, kNN and SVM classifiers are compared against those of ANN. Most the models generalize well in detecting cybercrime. ANN model performance on the test sets ranges from 70\% to 90\% accuracy compared to model performance range of 60\% to 80\% for the other three classifiers. The best performance is in detecting unfavorable fake reviews and fraud.},

  abstract = {The Writing Pal is an intelligent tutoring system that provides writing strategy training. A large part of its artificial intelligence resides in the natural language processing algorithms to assess essay quality and guide feedback to students. Because writing is often highly nuanced and subjective, the development of these algorithms must consider a broad array of linguistic, rhetorical, and contextual features. This study assesses the potential for computational indices to predict human ratings of essay quality. Past studies have demonstrated that linguistic indices related to lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity are significant predictors of human judgments of essay quality but that indices of cohesion are not. The present study extends prior work by including a larger data sample and an expanded set of indices to assess new lexical, syntactic, cohesion, rhetorical, and reading ease indices. Three models were assessed. The model reported by McNamara, Crossley, and McCarthy (Written Communication 27:57-86, 2010) including three indices of lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity accounted for only 6~\% of the variance in the larger data set. A regression model including the full set of indices examined in prior studies of writing predicted 38~\% of the variance in human scores of essay quality with 91~\% adjacent accuracy (i.e., within 1 point). A regression model that also included new indices related to rhetoric and cohesion predicted 44~\% of the variance with 94~\% adjacent accuracy. The new indices increased accuracy but, more importantly, afford the means to provide more meaningful feedback in the context of a writing tutoring system.},

In contrast to the hypothesis of Altshtein-Vogt dealing mainly with the problem of oncogene origin, the general theory of oncogenesis not only defines concretely the origin of the oncogene and the essence of its product, but also makes it possible to understand why, when and how integration of the oncogene with the genome of the cell leads to the transformation of the cell into a benign cell and when into a malignant tumour cell. An analysis of the essence of the "oncogene position effect" from this standpoint shows that an integration, similar in its mechanism but differing in polarity, of the genome of other viruses with the cell genome should lead to the formation of a corresponding antiviral stable (life-long) immunity or also to the emergence of pseudoautoimmune disease of the type caused by "slow" viruses.},

  abstract = {Statistical language models are crucial part of many successful applications, such as au- tomatic speech recognition and statistical machine translation (for example well-known Google Translate). Traditional techniques for estimating these models are based on N- gram counts. Despite known weaknesses of N-grams and huge efforts of research commu- nities across many fields (speech recognition, machine translation, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, data compression, psychology etc.), N-grams remained basically the state-of-the-art. The goal of this thesis is to present various archi- tectures of language models that are based on artificial neural networks. Although these models are computationally more expensive than N-gram models, with the presented techniques it is possible to apply them to state-of-the-art systems efficiently. Achieved reductions of word error rate of speech recognition systems are up to 20\%, against state- of-the-art N-gram model. The presented recurrent neural network based model achieves the best published performance on well-known Penn Treebank setup. Kl\textasciiacute cov\textasciiacute},

We analogize this to thinking `fast' in vector space along with thinking `slow' and `deeply' by reasoning over the knowledge graph. We have created a query processing engine that takes complex queries and decomposes them into subqueries optimized to run on the respective knowledge graph or vector view of a VKG. We show that the VKG structure can process specific queries that are not efficiently handled by vector spaces or knowledge graphs alone. We also demonstrate and evaluate the VKG structure and the query processing engine by developing a system called Cyber-All-Intel for knowledge extraction, representation and querying in an end-to-end pipeline grounded in the cybersecurity informatics domain.},

More recently, one member of the original collective, Fulvia Carnevale, has said that: I would like to say that Tiqqun is not an author, first of all. Tiqqun was a space for experimentation. It was an attempt at bridging the gap between theory and a number of practices and certain ways of being together. It was something that existed for a certain time and that then stopped because the people working at it werent happy with the relation between theory and practice and that certain people had decided that Tiqqun 3 would be a movie.2},

In this paper, we provide a review of how such statistical models can be ``trained'' on large knowledge graphs, and then used to predict new facts about the world (which is equivalent to predicting new edges in the graph). In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive datasets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google's Knowledge Vault project as an example of such combination.},

We systematically evaluate 62 classifiers representing 19 major algorithmic families against features extracted from the Jigsaw dataset of Wikipedia comments. We compare the classifiers based on statistically significant differences in accuracy and relative execution time. Among these classifiers for identifying toxic comments, tree-based algorithms provide the most transparently explainable rules and rank-order the predictive contribution of each feature. Among 28 features of syntax, sentiment, emotion and outlier word dictionaries, a simple bad word list proves most predictive of offensive commentary.},

This article is a demonstration of how to classify text using Long Term Term Memory (LSTM) network and their modifications, i.e. Bidirectional LSTM network and Gated Recurrent Unit. We present the superiority of this method over other algorithms for text classification on the example of three sets: Spambase Data Set, Farm Advertisement and Amazon book reviews. The results of the first two datasets were compared with AdaBoost ensemble of feedforward neural networks. In the case of the last database, the result is compared to the bag-of-words algorithm. In this article, we focus on classifying two groups in the first two collections, since we are only interested in whether something is classified into a SPAM or an eligible message. In the last dataset, we distinguish three classes.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Psychometric properties of the questionnaire were examined.Results:The questionnaire was found to have good reliability and validity. The main constructs of the theory of planned behaviour were useful in predicting intention to refer to paediatric psychology. Specific beliefs about referral were shown to influence intention to refer.Conclusion:Findings suggest that individual attitudes and beliefs can impact healthcare professionals? referral behaviour, indicating that multidisciplinary interventions and inter-professional education relating to the psychological aspects of illness are required.},

It is unclear, however, whether reading-strategy interventions are equally effective in whole-classroom situations in which the teacher is the sole instructor for the whole class. This meta-analysis focuses on the effects of reading-strategy interventions in whole-classroom settings. Results of studies on the effectiveness of reading-strategy interventions in whole-classroom settings were summarized (Nstudies\,=\,52, K\,=\,125) to determine the overall effects on reading comprehension and strategic ability. In addition, moderator effects of intervention, study, and student characteristics were explored. The analysis demonstrated a very small effect on reading comprehension (Cohen's d\,=\,.186) for standardized tests and a small effect (Cohen's d\,=\,.431) on researcher-developed reading comprehension tests. A medium overall effect was found for strategic ability (Cohen's d\,=\,.786). Intervention effects tended to be lower for studies that did not control for the hierarchical structure of the data (i.e. multilevel analyses).For interventions in which ``setting reading goals'' was part of the reading-strategy package, effects tended to be larger. In addition, effects were larger for interventions in which the trainer was the researcher as opposed to teachers and effect sizes tended to be larger for studies conducted in grades 6\textendash 8. Implications of these findings for future research and educational practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {The development of computational methods to detect abusive language in social media within variable and multilingual contexts has recently gained significant traction. The growing interest is confirmed by the large number of benchmark corpora for different languages developed in the latest years. However, abusive language behaviour is multifaceted and available datasets are featured by different topical focuses. This makes abusive language detection a domain-dependent task, and building a robust system to detect general abusive content a first challenge. Moreover, most resources are available for English, which makes detecting abusive language in low-resource languages a further challenge. We address both challenges by considering ten publicly available datasets across different domains and languages. A hybrid approach with deep learning and a multilingual lexicon to cross-domain and cross-lingual detection of abusive content is proposed and compared with other simpler models. We show that training a system on general abusive language datasets will produce a cross-domain robust system, which can be used to detect other more specific types of abusive content. We also found that using the domain-independent lexicon HurtLex is useful to transfer knowledge between domains and languages. In the cross-lingual experiment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our jointlearning model also in out-domain scenarios.},

This phenomenon has given rise to the growing need to detect the offensive language used in social media cross-lingually. In OffensEval 2020, the organizers have released the \textbackslash textit\{multilingual Offensive Language Identification Dataset\} (mOLID), which contains tweets in five different languages, to detect offensive language. In this work, we introduce a cross-lingual inductive approach to identify the offensive language in tweets using the contextual word embedding \textbackslash textit\{XLM-RoBERTa\} (XLM-R). We show that our model performs competitively on all five languages, obtaining the fourth position in the English task with an F1-score of \$0.919\$ and eighth position in the Turkish task with an F1-score of \$0.781\$. Further experimentation proves that our model works competitively in a zero-shot learning environment, and is extensible to other languages.},

  abstract = {One of the aims of Natural Language Processing is to facilitate .the use of computers by allowing their users to communicate in natural language. There are two important aspects to person-machine communication: understanding and generating. While natural language understanding has been a major focus of research, natural language generation is a relatively new and increasingly active field of research. This book presents an overview of the state of the art in natural language generation, describing both new results and directions for new research. The principal emphasis of natural language generation is not only to facili tate the use of computers but also to develop a computational theory of human language ability. In doing so, it is a tool for extending, clarifying and verifying theories that have been put forth in linguistics, psychology and sociology about how people communicate. A natural language generator will typically have access to a large body of knowledge from which to select information to present to users as well as numer of expressing it. Generating a text can thus be seen as a problem of ous ways decision-making under multiple constraints: constraints from the propositional knowledge at hand, from the linguistic tools available, from the communicative goals and intentions to be achieved, from the audience the text is aimed at and from the situation and past discourse. Researchers in generation try to identify the factors involved in this process and determine how best to represent the factors and their dependencies.},

By exploring ideas from a diverse range of disciplines "theory" encourages us to develop a deeper understanding of how we approach the written word. This book defines what is generically referred to as "critical theory," and guides readers through some of the most complex and fundamental concepts in the field, ranging from Historicism to Postmodernism, from Psychoanalytic Criticism to Race and Postcoloniality. Fully cross referenced throughout, the book encompasses manageable introductions to important ideas followed by a dictionary of terms and thinkers which students are likely to encounter. Further reading is offered to guide students to crucial primary essays and introductory chapters on each concept.}

  abstract = {This dissertation traces the post-Marxist and materialist positions of two leading contemporary European thinkers: Slavoj Zizek and Alain Badiou. These thinkers, I argue, collectively offer a way between the traditional Hegelian Marxist's overarching meta-narrative of a necessary evolution from worse to better, and the post-modern pessimism of a lack of possibility for such a social evolution. It is this middle path, offered by these two thinkers, that this dissertation seeks to explore and further explain. The focal point of this dissertation is the type of philosophical materialism that is collectively offered by Badiou and Zizek, what I call the "New Materialism." I first explain the origins of this materialist position as it emerges in the thought of Louis Althusser, then I discuss how Badiou and Zizek, each in their own way, seek to correct the remaining problems that exist for the Althusserian position, while refusing to reject its core materialist insights. Finally, I assess the ways in which both Badiou and Zizek attempt to overcome the Althusserian problems, arguing that ultimately Zizek's corrective succeeds in remaining within the materialist paradigm laid out by Althusser, whereas Badiou's method brings him dangerously close to a kind of philosophical idealism that he wishes to avoid.},

One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.},

  abstract = {Overfitting has been always considered as a challenging problem in designing and training of ensemble classifiers. Obviously, the use of complex multiple classifiers may increase the success of ensemble classifier in feature space division with intertwined data and also may decrease the training error to minimum value. However, this success does not exist on the test data. Ensemble classifiers are more prone to overfitting than single classifiers because ensemble classifiers have been formed of several base classifiers and overfitting occurrence in each base classifier can transfer the problem to the final decision of the ensemble. In this paper, after quantitative and qualitative analysis of overfitting, a solution for improving overfitting is proposed by using heuristic algorithms. In this way, Multi-Objective Inclined Planes Optimization (MOIPO) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) are used and their results are compared with each other. Simulation results show that the simultaneous minimization of ensemble size and error rate in the training phase, can lead to a significant reduction in the amount of overfitting. In fact, with this approach in the training phase, the ensemble classifier is required to minimize the error with the most simple and minimum number of base classifiers and therefore overfitting is prevented. However, previous researches related to overfitting have ignored the ensemble size as an objective function.},

  abstract = {Ethnic-racial socialisation is broadly described as processes by which both minority and majority children and young people learn about and negotiate racial, ethnic and cultural diversity. This article extends the existing ethnic-racial socialisation literature in three significant ways: (1) it explores ways children make sense of their experiences of racial and ethnic diversity and racism; (2) it considers ways children identify racism and make distinctions between racism and racialisation; and (3) it examines teacher and parent ethnic-racial socialisation messages about race, ethnicity and racism with children. This research is based on classroom observations, semi-structured interviews and focus groups with teachers, parents and students aged 8\textendash 12 years attending four Australian metropolitan primary schools. The findings reveal that both teachers and parents tended to discuss racism reactively rather than proactively. The extent to which racism was discussed in classroom settings depended on: teachers' personal and professional capability; awareness of racism and its perceived relevance based on student and community experiences; and whether they felt supported in the broader school and community context. For parents, key drivers for talking about racism were their children's experiences and racial issues reported in the media. For both parents and teachers, a key issue in these discussions was determining whether something constituted either racism or racialisation. Strategies on how ethnic-racial socialisation within the school system can be improved are discussed.},

In the original Hayes and Flower model, the authors posited a distinct process to manage this coordinating\textemdash that is, the ``monitor.'' The monitor became responsible for executive function in writing. In two experiments, the current authors investigated monitor function by examining the coordination of two common writing tasks\textemdash editing (i.e., correcting an error) and sentence composing\textemdash in the presence or absence of an error and with a low or high memory load for the writer. In the first experiment, participants could approach the editing and composing task in either order. On most trials (88\%), they finished the sentence first, and less frequently (12\%), they corrected the error first. The error-first approach occurred significantly more often under the low-load condition than the high-load condition. For the second experiment, participants were asked to adopt the less-used, error-first approach. Success in completing the assigned task order was affected by both memory load and error type. These results suggest that the monitor depends on the relative availability of working memory resources and coordinates subtasks to mitigate direct competition over those resources.},

Much of this book is about deliberate ambiguity, described as unambiguously as possible, so the previous sentence is probably the fIrst, last, and only deliberately ambiguous sentence in the book. Deliberate ambiguity will be shown to underlie much, if not all, of verbal humor. Some of its forms are simple enough to be perceived as deliberately ambiguous on the surface; in others, the ambiguity results from a deep semantic analysis. Deep semantic analysis is the core of this approach to humor. The book is the fIrst ever application of modem linguistic theory to the study of humor and it puts forward a formal semantic theory of verbal humor. The goal of the theory is to formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions, in purely semantic terms, for a text to be funny. In other words, if a formal semantic analysis of a text yields a certain set of semantic proptrties which the text possesses, then the text is recognized as a joke. As any modem linguistic theory, this semantic theory of humor attempts to match a natural intuitive ability which the native speaker has, in this particular case, the ability to perceive a text as funny, i. e. , to distinguish a joke from a non-joke.},

Indeed, in key respects, we could hardly imagine two more different philosophers. Heidegger seeks to recover a primordial sense of being that he believes has been lost through the history of the West. Foucault pursues an entirely contrary trajectory, calling into question both the primordial status of forms of thought and experience, and the transcendental closure of philosophical-historical narratives. Heidegger's work is focused on a single question (the question of being), developing a single way into this question. Foucault's work bears out a plethora of questions, methods, and theoretical tools, all predominantly determined by the exigencies of the varying problems at hand. These differences, among others, would strongly suggest that a broad reconciliation of Foucault and Heidegger's work is out of the question. Any attempt to articulate the relationship between these thinkers must proceed on the basis of specific points of correspondence, taking its lead from shared themes and concerns.},

After an interpolated task, they summarized the game and sorted passage sentences for idea importance. There was a significant main effect for prior knowledge on all measures. No interactions between prior knowledge and ability were found. These results delineate the powerful effect of prior knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Envisioning, a characteristic future-oriented technique for design thinking, often features as significant part of our research processes in the field. This paper compares, contrasts and critiques the varied ways in which envisionings have been used within ubiquitous computing and traces their relationships to other, different envisionings, such as those of virtual reality. In unpacking envisioning, it argues primarily that envisioning should be foregrounded as a significant concern and interest within HCI. Foregrounding envisionings frequent mix of fiction, forecasting and extrapolation, the paper recommends changes in the way we read, interpret and use envisionings through taking into account issues such as context and intended audience.},

Its analysis implies a set of subjective and fuzzy factors, such as the linguistic, psychological or sociological variables that produce it. This is one of the reasons why its automatic processing seems to be not straightforward. However, recent researches in the Natural Language Processing area have shown that humour can automatically be generated and recognised with success. On the basis of those achievements, in this study we present the experiments we have carried out on a collection of Italian texts in order to investigate how to characterize humour through the study of the ambiguity, especially with respect to morphosyntactic and syntactic ambiguity. The results we have obtained show that it is possible to differentiate humorous from non humorous data through features like perplexity or sentence complexity.},

  abstract = {Disclaimer: This paper is concerned with violent online harassment. To describe the subject at an adequate level of realism, examples of our collected tweets involve violent, threatening, vulgar and hateful speech language in the context of racial, sexual, political, appearance and intellectual harassment. The presence of a significant amount of harassment in user-generated content and its negative impact calls for robust automatic detection approaches. This requires that we can identify different forms or types of harassment. Earlier work has classified harassing language in terms of hurtfulness, abusiveness, sentiment, and profanity. However, to identify and understand harassment more accurately, it is essential to determine the context that represents the interrelated conditions in which they occur. In this paper, we introduce the notion of contextual type to harassment involving five categories: (i) sexual, (ii) racial, (iii) appearance-related, (iv) intellectual and (v) political. We utilize an annotated corpus from Twitter distinguishing these types of harassment. To study the context for each type that sheds light on the linguistic meaning, interpretation, and distribution, we conduct two lines of investigation: an extensive linguistic analysis, and a statistical distribution of unigrams. We then build type-ware classifiers to automate the identification of type-specific harassment. Our experiments demonstrate that these classifiers provide competitive accuracy for identifying and analyzing harassment on social media. We present extensive discussion and major observations about the effectiveness of type-aware classifiers using a detailed comparison setup providing insight into the role of type-dependent features.},

  abstract = {Narrative, and in particular storytelling, is an important part of the human experience. Consequently, computational systems that can reason about narrative can be more effective communicators, entertainers, educators, and trainers. One of the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative generation, the automated creation of meaningful event sequences. There are many factors -- logical and aesthetic -- that contribute to the success of a narrative artifact. Central to this success is its understandability. We argue that the following two attributes of narratives are universal: (a) the logical causal progression of plot, and (b) character believability. Character believability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by characters do not negatively impact the audiences suspension of disbelief. Specifically, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional agents. In this article, we explore the use of refinement search as a technique for solving the narrative generation problem -- to find a sound and believable sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a world state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel refinement search planning algorithm -- the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL) planner -- that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression, reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those characters commit to their goals. We present the results of an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the IPOCL algorithm support audience comprehension of character intentions better than plans generated by conventional partial-order planners.},

For example, many sarcastic tweets include a positive sentiment, such as ``love'' or ``enjoy'', followed by an expression that describes an undesirable activity or state (e.g., ``taking exams'' or ``being ignored''). We have developed a sarcasm recognizer to identify this type of sarcasm in tweets. We present a novel bootstrapping algorithm that automatically learns lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from sarcastic tweets. We show that identifying contrasting contexts using the phrases learned through bootstrapping yields improved recall for sarcasm recognition.},

  abstract = {Abstract Although 'modern' mental health care comprises a variety of theoretical approaches and practices, the supposed identification of 'mental illness' can be understood as being made on the basis of a specific conception of subjectivity that is characteristic of 'modernity'. This is to say that any perceived 'deviation' from this characteristically 'modern self' is seen as a possible 'sign' of 'mental illness', given a 'negative determination', and conceptualized in terms of a 'deficiency' or a 'lack'; accordingly, the 'ideal''therapeutic' aim of 'modern' mental health care can be understood as the 'rectification' of that 'deficiency' through a 're-instatement' of the 'modern self'. Although contemporary mental health care is increasingly becoming influenced by the so-called 'death' of the 'modern self', this paper will suggest that it is the work of the 20th century French philosopher, Gilles Deleuze, that is able to provide mental health care with a coherent determination of a 'post-modern self'. However, a Deleuzian account of subjectivity stands in stark contrast to 'modernity's' conception of subjectivity and, as such, this paper will attempt to show how this 'post-modern' subjectivity challenges many of the assumptions of 'modern' mental health care. Moreover, acknowledging the complexity and the perceived difficulty of Deleuze's work, this paper will provide an account of subjectivity that can be understood as 'Deleuzian' in its orientation, rather than 'Deleuze's theory of subjectivity', and therefore, this paper also seeks to stimulate further research and discussion of Deleuze's work on subjectivity, and how that work may be able to inform, and possibly even reform, the theoretical foundations and associated diagnostic and therapeutic practices of psychiatry, psychotherapy, and mental health nursing.},

  abstract = {We imagine posthumans as humans made superhumanly intelligent or resilient by future advances in nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science. Many argue that these enhanced people might live better lives; others fear that tinkering with our nature will undermine our sense of our own humanity. Whoever is right, it is assumed that our technological successor will be an upgraded or degraded version of us: Human 2.0.Posthuman Life argues that the enhancement debate projects a human face onto an empty screen. We do not know what will happen and, not being posthuman, cannot anticipate how posthumans will assess the world. If a posthuman future will not necessarily be informed by our kind of subjectivity or morality the limits of our current knowledge must inform any ethical or political assessment of that future. Posthuman Life develops a critical metaphysics of posthuman succession and argues that only a truly speculative posthumanism can support an ethics that meets the challenge of the transformative potential of technology.},

He also gives attention, however, to a range of perhaps less obvious topics, such as earthquakes, animals and animality, ghosts, monstrosity, the poematic, drugs, gifts, secrets, war and mourning. Derrida is seen as an extraordinarily inventive thinker, as well as a brilliantly imaginative and often very funny writer. Other critical introductions tend to highlight the specifically philosophical nature and genealogy of his work. Royle's book proceeds in a new and different way, in particular by focusing on the crucial but strange place of literature in Derrida's writings. He thus provides an appreciation and understanding based on detailed reference to Derrida's texts, interwoven with close readings of liter- ary works. In doing so, he explores Derrida's consistent view that deconstruction is a `coming-to-terms with literature'. He emphasizes the ways in which `literature', for Derrida, is indissociably bound up with other concerns, such as philosophy and psychoanalysis, politics and ethics, responsibility and justice, law and democracy},

  abstract = {The present study derives hypotheses from the General Theory of Verbal Humor (GTVH) and tests them on a sample of 534 subjects. Subjects are presented with three sets of jokes, each consisting of an anchor joke and comparison jokes in which variations in one and only one of the six Knowledge Resources (KR), script Opposition (SO), logical mechanism (LM), Situation (SI) target (TA), narrative strategy (NS), andlanguage (LA) occurred. Subjects rated the degree of similarity between the anchor joke and the six comparison jokes. The results support the hypothesis that the extent to which the similarity judgment is affected depends on the type of the KR manipulated. Also, there generally is a decreasing trend in similarity between the KRs LA and SO. Whereas there was a significant difference between all consecutive KRs, \"as predicted by the hierarchy postulated by the GTVH, SI and LM were not in the right order. Possible explanations for thisfact are discussed. This article presents and discusses a study which empirically Supports some of the Claims of the General Theory of Verbal Humor (GTVH). After introducing the theory, the article will present the hypotheses derived from the theory that were tested and finally the results of the investigation.

  author = {Rutter, J.},
  year = {1997},
  abstract = {This thesis explores stand-up comedy as live performance focusing on the manner in which audience, performer, jokes and venue combine to make a unique interactive experience. It outlines the failure of previous literature in humour research to move beyond simple stimulus models of joking and laughter. It argues for a shift in the study of humour towards in situ observation which draws on both conversation analysis and audience research. Through the observation of stand-up interaction the thesis demonstrates that audience laughter is organised in a consistent fashion and that the transition between comedian's talk and audience laughter is socially organised. In turn the thesis examines the openings, middles and closings of standup routines. It demonstrates that despite a considerable variety of performance style,comperes' introductions, the commencement of the comedians' routines themselves and the closing of acts, are organised around a set of common features each with a preferred order. Further, it demonstrates the active role played by the audience as well as the performer in maintaining this ordering. It shows how a feeling of "liveness" is built up out of these sequences as they are constructed specifically for,and respond to, individual audiences. Looking at the central section of stand-up routines this work demonstrates how jokes told by comedians incorporate a series of rhetorical and performance specific techniques which work towards announcing to an audience that a point of completion is approaching and that laughter is the preferred response. It is argued that this serves to minimise the audience's risk in laughing in a group situation and so is beneficial for both performer and audience. A new system for understanding stand-up is presented which pivots on notions of performance, interaction and liveness.},

It focuses on the theme of loneliness as experienced by participants as an inescapable part of their learning, writing and engagement with biographic material. One case study in particular is selected to illustrate points raised. Biographic narrative interviews were used throughout the study to explore ways in which the experience of learning and writing were impacting on a sense of identity. Although the substantive focus of the analysis was the interview data, this paper describes how a broader ethnographic approach was used to gain observational data and to explore the writing itself in order to build a richer picture of the individuals in the group. The paper focuses on a theme that emerged in various ways from the data as a whole; that of loneliness. Using the ideas of Melanie Klein to explore the links between learning, loneliness and reparation, the journey of one participant is described in detail. The research suggests that loneliness may be an integral part of being able to learn and build a new identity \textendash{} and that the reparation ushered in by an engagement with biographic material may be part of this process. This elaborate and lengthy process, however, is particularly fraught in learners with mental health difficulties and painful histories; the paper also, therefore, outlines the shortcomings of current adult and community educational policy.},

  abstract = {As Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-the-edge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains challenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40\%, while retaining 97\% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60\% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.},

  abstract = {The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with NAD+ and NADP+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques. The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50\% greater than those with NADP+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme. ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added. The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.},

  abstract = {One of the hardest problems in the area of Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence is automatically generating language that is coherent and understandable to humans. Teaching machines how to converse as humans do falls under the broad umbrella of Natural Language Generation. Recent years have seen unprecedented growth in the number of research articles published on this subject in conferences and journals both by academic and industry researchers. There have also been several workshops organized alongside top-tier NLP conferences dedicated specifically to this problem. All this activity makes it hard to clearly define the state of the field and reason about its future directions. In this work, we provide an overview of this important and thriving area, covering traditional approaches, statistical approaches and also approaches that use deep neural networks. We provide a comprehensive review towards building open domain dialogue systems, an important application of natural language generation. We find that, predominantly, the approaches for building dialogue systems use seq2seq or language models architecture. Notably, we identify three important areas of further research towards building more effective dialogue systems: 1) incorporating larger context, including conversation context and world knowledge; 2) adding personae or personality in the NLG system; and 3) overcoming dull and generic responses that affect the quality of system-produced responses. We provide pointers on how to tackle these open problems through the use of cognitive architectures that mimic human language understanding and generation capabilities.},

Due to the popularity of social media cyberbullying become the major problem in online communication and cyberbullying behavior received more and more attention. Cyberbullying may cause many serious and negative impacts on person's life and even leads to teen suicide. In the existing system the set of unique features derived from Twitter such as network, activity, user and tweet contents. By using these features the cyberbullying words which are presented in the tweet contents are detected using machine learning algorithms. The rumor tweets are detected using syntactic and semantic techniques. The cyberbully detection and rumor detection on twitter network are done separately in the existing technique. In the proposed work the detection of cyberbully words and rumor tweets on twitter are integrated into a single application, along with these the cyberbully contents in the tweet comments will be detected using Na\"ive Bayes and Random Forest classifier. The name, gender and age of the cyberbully tweeted people will also be detected using feature extraction technique. By using type and topic specific classification and Twitter speech-act classifier, the rumor tweets will also be detected in this proposed work.},

The secretion parameters were measured during a 1-h basal period and a 2-h stimulation period. The gastric juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube. Stimulation was effected by 1 mug/kg/h pentagastrin via drip infusion. The Friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation, and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the Wilcoxon test (pair-differences rank). The results show that Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume. As compared with placebo, it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone. Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid, while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion. None of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid, although both Sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values. During the basal secretion period, all three test preparations had an inhibiting action on acid concentration, but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period. The pH value was savely increased only by Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam, and this even only during the basal period. The results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Researchers have recently started investigating deep neural networks for dialogue applications. In particular, generative sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models have shown promising results for unstructured tasks, such as word-level dialogue response generation. The hope is that such models will be able to leverage massive amounts of data to learn meaningful natural language representations and response generation strategies, while requiring a minimum amount of domain knowledge and hand-crafting. An important challenge is to develop models that can effectively incorporate dialogue context and generate meaningful and diverse responses. In support of this goal, we review recently proposed models based on generative encoder-decoder neural network architectures, and show that these models have better ability to incorporate long-term dialogue history, to model uncertainty and ambiguity in dialogue, and to generate responses with high-level compositional structure.},

To do this, however, data needs to be analyzed in typically nontrivial refinement processes, which require technical expertise about methods and algorithms, experience with how a precise analysis should proceed, and knowledge about an exploding number of analytic approaches. To alleviate these problems, a plethora of different systems have been proposed that ``intelligently'' help users to analyze their data. This article provides a first survey to almost 30 years of research on intelligent discovery assistants (IDAs). It explicates the types of help IDAs can provide to users and the kinds of (background) knowledge they leverage to provide this help. Furthermore, it provides an overview of the systems developed over the past years, identifies their most important features, and sketches an ideal future IDA as well as the challenges on the road ahead.},

Although the original goal behind the SCT was to require systems to perform deep language understanding and commonsense reasoning for successful narrative understanding, some recent models could perform significantly better than the initial baselines by leveraging human-authorship biases discovered in the SCT dataset. In order to shed some light on this issue, we have performed various data analysis and analyzed a variety of top performing models presented for this task. Given the statistics we have aggregated, we have designed a new crowdsourcing scheme that creates a new SCT dataset, which overcomes some of the biases. We benchmark a few models on the new dataset and show that the topperforming model on the original SCT dataset fails to keep up its performance. Our findings further signify the importance of benchmarking NLP systems on various evolving test sets.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

  abstract = {Paul Ricoeur is one of the most important critical thinkers to emerge in the twentieth century. His unique `theory of reading' or hermeneutics extends far beyond the reading of literary works to build into a theory for the reading of `life'. As a result of this, such works as Philosophy of the Will, The Rule of Metaphor, Time and Narrative and Oneself as Another have impacted upon the widest range of disciplines, from literary criti- cism and philosophy to history, religion, legal studies and politics. In this stimulating guide, Karl Simms explores Ricoeur's most influential ideas, touching upon such concepts as good and evil, psycho- analysis, hermeneutics, metaphor, narrative, ethics, politics and justice. Crucially, he also places these ideas in context and looks at their contin- uing impact, in this way introducing important trends in contemporary thought. Throughout this volume, the author prepares us for our own reading of Ricoeur's work, and this culminates in an extensively anno- tated guide to his major publications. Refreshingly clear and impressively comprehensive, Paul Ricoeur is the essential guide to an essential theorist.},

  abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a ``black art'' requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes bruteforce search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

As the importance of PCG for game development increases, researchers explore new avenues for generating high-quality content with or without human involvement; this paper addresses the relatively new paradigm of using machine learning (in contrast with search-based, solver-based, and constructive methods). We focus on what is most often considered functional game content such as platformer levels, game maps, interactive fiction stories, and cards in collectible card games, as opposed to cosmetic content such as sprites and sound effects. In addition to using PCG for autonomous generation, co-creativity, mixed-initiative design, and compression, PCGML is suited for repair, critique, and content analysis because of its focus on modeling existing content. We discuss various data sources and representations that affect the resulting generated content. Multiple PCGML methods are covered, including neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, autoencoders, and deep convolutional networks; Markov models, \$n\$-grams, and multi-dimensional Markov chains; clustering; and matrix factorization. Finally, we discuss open problems in the application of PCGML, including learning from small datasets, lack of training data, multi-layered learning, style-transfer, parameter tuning, and PCG as a game mechanic.},

  abstract = {In the past decade there have been efforts to understand the war on terror through the writings of Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben. Some analyses reify certain concepts employed by Fou- cault and Agamben. Others do not accurately represent the ac- tual occurrence of violence at ground level. Without claiming to present a sovereign gaze on the literature and the reading of sov- ereign violence in places such as Gu\'antanamo, this article argues that there are at least three central elements that philosophers and theorists might want to reconsider in connection with sov- ereignty, biopower, and subjectivity: that there is a Derridean logic at play between sovereignty and biopower; that there is a connection between sovereignty and subjectivity informed by a ``dangerous connection'' between power and knowledge; and that sovereignty is informed by a classifying and hierarchizing regime characteristic of a regime of truth. Although Agamben claims to correct Foucault, he betrays important methodological and epistemological elements of Foucault's work. Nevertheless, there are elements in Agamben's work that can shape our under- standing of a ``biopolitical reading'' of our contemporary era.},

In lively and erudite prose, Thompson argues for a self-critical and unapologetically humanist Marxist tradition. Also included are three essays of considerable importance to the development of the New Left. Called ``essential reading for American radicals'' by The Nation, this book is one no serious socialist can afford to be without.},

Compared with EUA Ss, AFA Ss seemed to think that they were being singled out for differential and inferior treatment. This feeling was strongest among AFA Ss who were distrustful of EUAs in general. Implications of this finding for counseling, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed. Low reliability coefficients limit the usefulness of the RRS as both a research instrument and a tool for working with individual students. However, as a culture-specific variable related to within-group differences, racism reaction should be further explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The article touches on the interpretive debates around Marx's 1857 Introduction and tries to identify the tensions and contradictions at work in the distinctive contributions of Louis Althusser, Alfred Sohn-Rethel, and Roberto Finelli to thinking on the specific status of abstraction, in terms of both the methodology of Marxism and the logic and ontology of capitalism. These foundational debates are then contrasted with attempts by Paolo Virno and Lorenzo Cillario to think the contemporary figures of abstraction in terms of its politicization, on the one hand, and its operational role in the labor process, on the other.},

  abstract = {We present two experiments on the automated detection of racist discourse in Dutch social media. In both experiments, multiple classifiers are trained on the same training set. This training set consists of Dutch posts retrieved from two public Belgian social media pages which are likely to attract racist reactions. The posts were labeled as racist or non-racist by multiple annotators, who reached an acceptable agreement score. The different classification models all use the Support Vector Machine algorithm, but use different (sets of) linguistic features, which can be lexical, stylistic or dictionary-based. In the first experiment, the models are evaluated on a test set containing unseen comments retrieved from the same pages as the training set (and thus also skewed towards racism). In the second experiment, the same models from Experiment 1 are tested on an alternative test set, containing more neutral comments, retrieved from the social media page of a Belgian newspaper. In both experiments, the best performing model relies on a dictionary containing different word categories specifically related to racist discourse. It reaches an F-score of 0.47 (exp. 1) and 0.40 (exp. 2) for the racist class and ROC Area Under Curve scores of 0.64 (exp. 1) and 0.73 (exp. 2).

  abstract = {We present a dictionary-based approach to racism detection in Dutch social media comments, which were retrieved from two public Belgian social media sites likely to attract racist reactions. These comments were labeled as racist or non-racist by multiple annotators. For our approach, three discourse dictionaries were created: first, we created a dictionary by retrieving possibly racist and more neutral terms from the training data, and then augmenting these with more general words to remove some bias. A second dictionary was created through automatic expansion using a \textbackslash texttt\{word2vec\} model trained on a large corpus of general Dutch text. Finally, a third dictionary was created by manually filtering out incorrect expansions. We trained multiple Support Vector Machines, using the distribution of words over the different categories in the dictionaries as features. The best-performing model used the manually cleaned dictionary and obtained an F-score of 0.46 for the racist class on a test set consisting of unseen Dutch comments, retrieved from the same sites used for the training set. The automated expansion of the dictionary only slightly boosted the model's performance, and this increase in performance was not statistically significant. The fact that the coverage of the expanded dictionaries did increase indicates that the words that were automatically added did occur in the corpus, but were not able to meaningfully impact performance.

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \textbackslash AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Text modification has many applications within text generation like interactive narrative systems, where stories tailored to specific users are generated by adapting or instantiating a pre-authored story. We present a case-based approach where cases correspond to pairs of sentences implementing specific modifications. We describe our retrieval, adaptation and revise procedures.

  abstract = {Recent work on cyberbullying detection relies on using machine learning models with text and metadata in small datasets, mostly drawn from single social media platforms. Such models have succeeded in predicting cyberbullying when dealing with posts containing the text and the metadata structure as found on the platform. Instead, we develop a multi-platform dataset that consists purely of the text from posts gathered from seven social media platforms. We present a multi-stage and multi-technique annotation system that initially uses crowdsourcing for post and hashtag annotation and subsequently utilizes machine-learning methods to identify additional posts for annotation. This process has the benefit of selecting posts for annotation that have a significantly greater than chance likelihood of constituting clear cases of cyberbullying without limiting the range of samples to those containing predetermined features (as is the case when hashtags alone are used to select posts for annotation). We show that, despite the diversity of examples present in the dataset, good performance is possible for models trained on datasets produced in this manner. This becomes a clear advantage compared to traditional methods of post selection and labeling because it increases the number of positive examples that can be produced using the same resources and it enhances the diversity of communication media to which the models can be applied.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

This paper presents a unification of two journey-based story generation models, the character-development model of The Flux Capacitor and the plot development model of Sc\'ealextric. This union of complementary approaches allows us to build stories with shape and directionality. Moreover, since it facilitates the generation of coherent stories by the most minimal of computing architectures, the memory-less state machine, this joint model proves to be ideally suited to the generation of stories by bots. To squeeze a full story-generator into the context-free grammars of Tracery, we give a practical form to two exotic ideas: predestination, and bicamerality of mind.},

The kappa statistic (or kappa coefficient) is the most commonly used statistic for this purpose. A kappa of 1 indicates perfect agreement, whereas a kappa of 0 indicates agreement equivalent to chance. A limitation of kappa is that it is affected by the prevalence of the finding under observation. Methods to overcome this limitation have been described.},

Besides improving performance, an advantage of using attention is that it can also help to interpret a model by showing how the model assigns weight to different input elements. However, the multi-layer, multi-head attention mechanism in the Transformer model can be difficult to decipher. To make the model more accessible, we introduce an open-source tool that visualizes attention at multiple scales, each of which provides a unique perspective on the attention mechanism. We demonstrate the tool on BERT and OpenAI GPT-2 and present three example use cases: detecting model bias, locating relevant attention heads, and linking neurons to model behavior.},

  abstract = {Globalization is forcing us to rethink some of the categoriessuch as "the people"that traditionally have been associated with the now eroding state. Italian political thinker Paolo Virno argues that the category of "multitude," elaborated by Spinoza and for the most part left fallow since the seventeenth century, is a far better tool to analyze contemporary issues than the Hobbesian concept of "people," favored by classical political philosophy. Hobbes, who detested the notion of multitude, defined it as shunning political unity, resisting authority, and never entering into lasting agreements. "When they rebel against the state," Hobbes wrote, "the citizens are the multitude against the people." But the multitude isn't just a negative notion, it is a rich concept that allows us to examine anew plural experiences and forms of nonrepresentative democracy. Drawing from philosophy of language, political economics, and ethics, Virno shows that being foreign, "not-feeling-at-home-anywhere," is a condition that forces the multitude to place its trust in the intellect. In conclusion, Virno suggests that the metamorphosis of the social systems in the West during the last twenty years is leading to a paradoxical "Communism of the Capital."},

Quality evaluation connects narrative understanding and generation as generation systems need to evaluate their own products. To circumvent difficulties in acquiring annotations, we employ upvotes in social media as an approximate measure for story quality. We collected 54,484 answers from a crowd-powered question-and-answer website, Quora, and then used active learning to build a classifier that labeled 28,320 answers as stories. To predict the number of upvotes without the use of social network features, we create neural networks that model textual regions and the interdependence among regions, which serve as strong benchmarks for future research. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale study for automatic evaluation of narrative quality.},

  abstract = {Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language processing (NLP) since it can transfer knowledge to downstream tasks. Meanwhile, a contextualized word representation, called BERT, achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quite a few NLP tasks. Yet, it is an open problem to generate a high quality sentence representation from BERT-based word models. It was shown in previous study that different layers of BERT capture different linguistic properties. This allows us to fusion information across layers to find better sentence representation. In this work, we study the layer-wise pattern of the word representation of deep contextualized models. Then, we propose a new sentence embedding method by dissecting BERT-based word models through geometric analysis of the space spanned by the word representation. It is called the SBERT-WK method. No further training is required in SBERT-WK. We evaluate SBERT-WK on semantic textual similarity and downstream supervised tasks. Furthermore, ten sentence-level probing tasks are presented for detailed linguistic analysis. Experiments show that SBERT-WK achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Our codes are publicly available.},

In the recordings categorized as effective, clinicians demonstrated accommodative emotional expression and interactants engaged in more accommodative interpretability and interpersonal control strategies than in ineffective recordings. In Study 2, the same recordings were analyzed using Discursis (a textual analysis software program). Discursis uses new technology to visualize and identify speaker approximation. Approximation patterns correlated with findings from Study 1. Results provide insights into which CAT strategies assist managing open disclosure.},

  year = {1997},
  address = {{Pittsburgh, PA, USA}},
  abstract = {In traditional drama, an audience watches a story presented by characters on a stage. Interactive Drama changes the audience to a single User who enters that stage, interacting with the characters, and participating in the story. Computer-based interactive drama allows a User to interact with simulated worlds which are inhabited by dynamic and complex autonomous characters and shaped by a flexible, aesthetically pleasing story. Unlike the actions of characters in a play, the actions of the User are not controlled by the artist. The problem is to shape the User's experience to conform to the set of themes and ideas to be conveyed. This work proposes this problem can be solved by dynamically monitoring and subtly guiding the experience of the User.This dissertation describes an architecture called Moe that is designed to provide dramatic guidance. Moe uses abstract, adversary search with an aesthetic evaluation function to decide how and when to guide the User's experience. The first technical achievement of this work is a demonstration of the ability to capture a dramatic aesthetic (for one interactive drama) in an automated evaluation function that can examine an experience and determine its quality, much as a movie critic determines the quality of a film. This result is supported by statistically demonstrating a high degree of correlation (r =.87) between the evaluation function and the human artist.The second main technical achievement of this work is the implementation of three such strategies (SAS and SAS+, both based on random sampling; and MMFC, which uses memoization to implement a full-depth search) and a search state that seem capable of effectively modelling and guiding an interactive dramatic experience. Moe has not yet been connected to a running interactive experience, but instead Moe has been tested with a variety of Simulated User Types. On "average" Users, SAS, SAS+, and MMFC are able to improve Users' experiences from the 50th percentile, to the 94th, 98th, and 99th percentile, respectively. This is a large and artistically meaningful increase.This dissertation describes the first implementation of a system designed to provide centralized dramatic guidance in an interactive drama.},

We introduce Hybrid Code Networks (HCNs), which combine an RNN with domain-specific knowledge encoded as software and system action templates. Compared to existing end-to-end approaches, HCNs considerably reduce the amount of training data required, while retaining the key benefit of inferring a latent representation of dialog state. In addition, HCNs can be optimized with supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or a mixture of both. HCNs attain state-of-the-art performance on the bAbI dialog dataset, and outperform two commercially deployed customer-facing dialog systems.},

Existing work either concatenates utterances in context or matches a response with a highly abstract context vector finally, which may lose relationships among utterances or important contextual information. We propose a sequential matching network (SMN) to address both problems. SMN first matches a response with each utterance in the context on multiple levels of granularity, and distills important matching information from each pair as a vector with convolution and pooling operations. The vectors are then accumulated in a chronological order through a recurrent neural network (RNN) which models relationships among utterances. The final matching score is calculated with the hidden states of the RNN. An empirical study on two public data sets shows that SMN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods for response selection in multi-turn conversation.},

However, understanding the prevalence and impact of personal attacks in online platforms at scale remains surprisingly difficult. The contribution of this paper is to develop and illustrate a method that combines crowdsourcing and machine learning to analyze personal attacks at scale. We show an evaluation method for a classifier in terms of the aggregated number of crowd-workers it can approximate. We apply our methodology to English Wikipedia, generating a corpus of over 100k high quality human-labeled comments and 63M machine-labeled ones from a classifier that is as good as the aggregate of 3 crowd-workers, as measured by the area under the ROC curve and Spearman correlation. Using this corpus of machine-labeled scores, our methodology allows us to explore some of the open questions about the nature of online personal attacks. This reveals that the majority of personal attacks on Wikipedia are not the result of a few malicious users, nor primarily the consequence of allowing anonymous contributions from unregistered users.},

The training should be done in such a way that while the model has enough instances to train on, they should not over-fit the model and at the same time, it must be considered that if there are not enough instances to train on, the model would not be trained properly and would give poor results when used for testing. Accuracy is important when it comes to classification and one must always strive to achieve the highest accuracy, provided there is not trade off with inexcusable time. While working on small datasets, the ideal choices are k-fold cross-validation with large value of k (but smaller than number of instances) or leave-one-out cross-validation whereas while working on colossal datasets, the first thought is to use holdout validation, in general. This article studies the differences between the two validation schemes, analyzes the possibility of using k-fold cross-validation over hold-out validation even on large datasets. Experimentation was performed on four large datasets and results show that till a certain threshold, k-fold cross-validation with varying value of k with respect to number of instances can indeed be used over hold-out validation for quality classification.},

However, previous work on this topic did not consider the problem as a whole, but rather focused on detecting very specific types of offensive content, e.g., hate speech, cyberbulling, or cyber-aggression. In contrast, here we target several different kinds of offensive content. In particular, we model the task hierarchically, identifying the type and the target of offensive messages in social media. For this purpose, we complied the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a new dataset with tweets annotated for offensive content using a fine-grained three-layer annotation scheme, which we make publicly available. We discuss the main similarities and differences between OLID and pre-existing datasets for hate speech identification, aggression detection, and similar tasks. We further experiment with and we compare the performance of different machine learning models on OLID.},

The task was based on a new dataset, the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), which contains over 14,000 English tweets. It featured three sub-tasks. In sub-task A, the goal was to discriminate between offensive and non-offensive posts. In sub-task B, the focus was on the type of offensive content in the post. Finally, in sub-task C, systems had to detect the target of the offensive posts. OffensEval attracted a large number of participants and it was one of the most popular tasks in SemEval-2019. In total, about 800 teams signed up to participate in the task, and 115 of them submitted results, which we present and analyze in this report.},

Outcome measures used in 65 studies of child care quality published between 1979 and December 2005 were examined, taking the previous review by Vandell and Wolfe (2000) as the starting point. Serious methodological problems were not pervasive for child outcome measures. However, methodological concerns were most prevalent among measures of socioemotional development. Furthermore, psychometric information on outcome measures was often missing from published reports, and health outcomes and approaches to learning were infrequently studied. Future research should address alignment issues between aspects of quality and the specific child outcomes chosen for study.},

  abstract = {One way to approach end-to-end autonomous driving is to learn a policy function that maps from a sensory input, such as an image frame from a front-facing camera, to a driving action, by imitating an expert driver, or a reference policy. This can be done by supervised learning, where a policy function is tuned to minimize the difference between the predicted and ground-truth actions. A policy function trained in this way however is known to suffer from unexpected behaviours due to the mismatch between the states reachable by the reference policy and trained policy functions. More advanced algorithms for imitation learning, such as DAgger, addresses this issue by iteratively collecting training examples from both reference and trained policies. These algorithms often requires a large number of queries to a reference policy, which is undesirable as the reference policy is often expensive. In this paper, we propose an extension of the DAgger, called SafeDAgger, that is query-efficient and more suitable for end-to-end autonomous driving. We evaluate the proposed SafeDAgger in a car racing simulator and show that it indeed requires less queries to a reference policy. We observe a significant speed up in convergence, which we conjecture to be due to the effect of automated curriculum learning.},

The independent variable was a dummy variable, which was coded as 1 for illiterate or semiliterate, and 0 for literate. Dependent variables were indicators of physical and mental health derived from the survey results. Matching methodologies controlled for confounding variables including age, sex, living sites, access to tap water and financial support.Results:Illiteracy was found to have a significant impact on physical health, exercise habits, anxiety, loneliness and happiness. On average, illiteracy decreased physical health by 19.9\%, decreased exercise habits by 7\%, increased anxiety by 11.56\%, increased loneliness by 17.6\% and decreased happiness by 11.3\%.Conclusion:Findings confirm the past literature in which illiteracy has been found to be adversely associated with physical and mental health. The analysis uniquely found that illiteracy had a higher cost on mental health as compared to physical health for elderly people in China.},

  abstract = {The latest work on language representations carefully integrates contextualized features into language model training, which enables a series of success especially in various machine reading comprehension and natural language inference tasks. However, the existing language representation models including ELMo, GPT and BERT only exploit plain context-sensitive features such as character or word embeddings. They rarely consider incorporating structured semantic information which can provide rich semantics for language representation. To promote natural language understanding, we propose to incorporate explicit contextual semantics from pre-trained semantic role labeling, and introduce an improved language representation model, Semantics-aware BERT (SemBERT), which is capable of explicitly absorbing contextual semantics over a BERT backbone. SemBERT keeps the convenient usability of its BERT precursor in a light fine-tuning way without substantial task-specific modifications. Compared with BERT, semantics-aware BERT is as simple in concept but more powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art or substantially improves results on ten reading comprehension and language inference tasks.},

  abstract = {Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is one of the most popular architectures used in Natural Language Processsing (NLP) tasks because its recurrent structure is very suitable to process variable-length text. RNN can utilize distributed representations of words by first converting the tokens comprising each text into vectors, which form a matrix. And this matrix includes two dimensions: the time-step dimension and the feature vector dimension. Then most existing models usually utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-based operation only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector. However, the features on the feature vector dimension are not mutually independent, and simply applying 1D pooling operation over the time-step dimension independently may destroy the structure of the feature representation. On the other hand, applying two-dimensional (2D) pooling operation over the two dimensions may sample more meaningful features for sequence modeling tasks. To integrate the features on both dimensions of the matrix, this paper explores applying 2D max pooling operation to obtain a fixed-length representation of the text. This paper also utilizes 2D convolution to sample more meaningful information of the matrix. Experiments are conducted on six text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, question classification, subjectivity classification and newsgroup classification. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the proposed models achieve excellent performance on 4 out of 6 tasks. Specifically, one of the proposed models achieves highest accuracy on Stanford Sentiment Treebank binary classification and fine-grained classification tasks.},

Its limitations derive chiefly from the reliance on theoretical Deleuzean language at the expense of concreteness, and the absence of practical, viable modes of achieving the emancipatory goals that the authors exhort.
